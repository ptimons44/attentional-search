        "The fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of differentiating a function (calculating its slopes, or rate of change at each time) with the concept of integrating a function (calculating the area under its graph, or the cumulative effect of small contributions). The two operations are inverses of each other apart from a constant value which depends on where one starts to compute area.\n The first part of the theorem, the first fundamental theorem of calculus, states that for a function f , an antiderivative or indefinite integral F may be obtained as the integral of f over an interval with a variable upper bound. This implies the existence of antiderivatives for continuous functions.[1]\n Conversely, the second part of the theorem, the second fundamental theorem of calculus, states that the integral of a function f over a fixed interval is equal to the change of any antiderivative F between the ends of the interval. This greatly simplifies the calculation of a definite integral provided an antiderivative can be found by symbolic integration, thus avoiding numerical integration.\n The fundamental theorem of calculus relates differentiation and integration, showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another. Before the discovery of this theorem, it was not recognized that these two operations were related. Ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to compute area via infinitesimals, an operation that we would now call integration. The origins of differentiation likewise predate the fundamental theorem of calculus by hundreds of years; for example, in the fourteenth century the notions of continuity of functions and motion were studied by the Oxford Calculators and other scholars. The historical relevance of the fundamental theorem of calculus is not the ability to calculate these operations, but the realization that the two seemingly distinct operations (calculation of geometric areas, and calculation of gradients) are actually closely related.\n From the conjecture and the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus, calculus as a unified theory of integration and differentiation is started. The first published statement and proof of a rudimentary form of the fundamental theorem, strongly geometric in character,[2] was by James Gregory (1638\u20131675).[3][4] Isaac Barrow (1630\u20131677) proved a more generalized version of the theorem,[5] while his student Isaac Newton (1642\u20131727) completed the development of the surrounding mathematical theory. Gottfried Leibniz (1646\u20131716) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today.\n The first fundamental theorem may be interpreted as follows. Given a continuous function y = f(x) whose graph is plotted as a curve, one defines a corresponding \"area function\" \n\n\n\nx\n\u21a6\nA\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\mapsto A(x)}\n\n such that A(x) is the area beneath the curve between 0 and x. The area A(x) may be not easily computable, but it is assumed to be well defined.\n The area under the curve between x and x + h could be computed by finding the area between 0 and x + h, then subtracting the area between 0 and x. In other words, the area of this \"strip\" would be A(x + h) \u2212 A(x).\n There is another way to estimate the area of this same strip. As shown in the accompanying figure, h is multiplied by f(x) to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this strip. So:\n\n\n\n\nA\n(\nx\n+\nh\n)\n\u2212\nA\n(\nx\n)\n\u2248\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\u22c5\nh\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A(x+h)-A(x)\\approx f(x)\\cdot h}\n\n\n In fact, this estimate becomes a perfect equality if we add the red \"Excess\" area in the diagram. So:\n\n\n\n\nA\n(\nx\n+\nh\n)\n\u2212\nA\n(\nx\n)\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\u22c5\nh\n+\n\n\u00a0(Excess)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A(x+h)-A(x)=f(x)\\cdot h+{\\text{ (Excess)}}}\n\n\n Rearranging terms:\n\n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\n\n\nA\n(\nx\n+\nh\n)\n\u2212\nA\n(\nx\n)\n\nh\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nExcess\nh\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}}-{\\frac {\\text{Excess}}{h}}.}\n\n\n \nAs h approaches 0 in the limit, the last fraction must go to zero.[6] To see this, note that the excess region is inside the tiny black-bordered rectangle, giving an upper bound for the excess area: \n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nExcess\n\n\n|\n\n\u2264\nh\n\n(\nf\n(\nx\n\n+\n\n\nh\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\u2212\nf\n(\nx\n\n+\n\n\nh\n\n2\n\n\n)\n)\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |{\\text{Excess}}|\\leq h\\,(f(x{+}h_{1})-f(x{+}h_{2})),}\n\n where \n\n\n\nx\n+\n\nh\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x+h_{1}}\n\n and \n\n\n\nx\n+\n\nh\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x+h_{2}}\n\n are points where f  reaches its maximum and its minimum, respectively, in the interval [x, x + h].\n Thus:\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\u2212\n\n\n\nA\n(\nx\n+\nh\n)\n\u2212\nA\n(\nx\n)\n\nh\n\n\n\n|\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nExcess\n\n\n|\n\n\nh\n\n\n\u2264\n\n\n\nh\n(\nf\n(\nx\n+\n\nh\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\u2212\nf\n(\nx\n+\n\nh\n\n2\n\n\n)\n)\n\nh\n\n\n=\nf\n(\nx\n\n+\n\n\nh\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\u2212\nf\n(\nx\n\n+\n\n\nh\n\n2\n\n\n)\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\left|f(x)-{\\frac {A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}}\\right|={\\frac {|{\\text{Excess}}|}{h}}\\leq {\\frac {h(f(x+h_{1})-f(x+h_{2}))}{h}}=f(x{+}h_{1})-f(x{+}h_{2}),}\n\nBy the continuity of f, the right-hand expression tends to zero as h does. Therefore, the left-hand side also tends to zero, and:\n \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\nlim\n\nh\n\u2192\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n(\nx\n+\nh\n)\n\u2212\nA\n(\nx\n)\n\nh\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\ndef\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nA\n\u2032\n\n(\nx\n)\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)=\\lim _{h\\to 0}{\\frac {A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}}\\ {\\stackrel {\\text{def}}{=}}\\ A'(x).}\n\n\n \nThat is, the derivative of the area function A(x) exists and is equal to the original function f(x), so the area function is an antiderivative of the original function. \n Thus, the derivative of the integral of a function (the area) is the original function, so that derivative and integral are inverse operations which reverse each other. This is the essence of the Fundamental Theorem.\n Intuitively, the fundamental theorem states that integration and differentiation are essentially inverse operations which reverse each other.\n The second fundamental theorem says that the sum of infinitesimal changes in a quantity over time (the integral of the derivative of the quantity) adds up to the net change in the quantity. To visualize this, imagine traveling in a car and wanting to know the distance traveled (the net change in position along the highway). You can see the velocity on the speedometer but cannot look out to see your location. Each second, you can find how far the car has traveled using distance = speed \u00d7 time, multiplying the current speed (in kilometers or miles per hour) by the time interval (1 second = \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3600\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{3600}}}\n\n hour). Summing up all these small steps, you can calculate the total distance traveled, without ever looking outside the car:\n\n\n\n\ndistance traveled\n\n=\n\u2211\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\nvelocity at\n\n\n\n\n\n\neach time\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u00d7\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\ntime\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninterval\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\u2211\nv\n(\nt\n)\n\u00d7\n\u0394\nt\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{distance traveled}}=\\sum \\left({\\begin{array}{c}{\\text{velocity at}}\\\\{\\text{each time}}\\end{array}}\\right)\\times \\left({\\begin{array}{c}{\\text{time}}\\\\{\\text{interval}}\\end{array}}\\right)=\\sum v(t)\\times \\Delta t.}\n\nAs \n\n\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta t}\n\n becomes infinitesimally small, the summing up corresponds to integration. Thus, the integral of the velocity function (the derivative of position) computes how far the car has traveled (the net change in position).\n The first fundamental theorem says that any quantity is the rate of change (the derivative) of the integral of the quantity from a fixed time up to a variable time. Continuing the above example, if you imagine a velocity function, you can integrate it from the starting time up to any given time to obtain a distance function whose derivative is the given velocity. (To obtain the highway-marker position, you need to add your starting position to this integral.)\n There are two parts to the theorem. The first part deals with the derivative of an antiderivative, while the second part deals with the relationship between antiderivatives and definite integrals.\n This part is sometimes referred to as the first fundamental theorem of calculus.[7]\n Let f be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval [a, b].

Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and n increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get closer and closer to the actual area of the curve.\n By taking the limit of the expression as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the Riemann integral. We know that this limit exists because f was assumed to be integrable. That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity.\n So, we take the limit on both sides of (2').

That is, suppose G is an antiderivative of f. Then by the second theorem, \n\n\n\nG\n(\nx\n)\n\u2212\nG\n(\na\n)\n=\n\n\u222b\n\na\n\n\nx\n\n\nf\n(\nt\n)\n\nd\nt\n\n\n{\\textstyle G(x)-G(a)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt}\n\n.

Then F has the same derivative as G, and therefore F\u2032 = f. This argument only works, however, if we already know that f has an antiderivative, and the only way we know that all continuous functions have antiderivatives is by the first part of the Fundamental Theorem.[1]\nFor example, if f(x) = e\u2212x2, then f has an antiderivative, namely\n\n\n\n\nG\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\n\u222b\n\n0\n\n\nx\n\n\nf\n(\nt\n)\n\nd\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G(x)=\\int _{0}^{x}f(t)\\,dt}\n\n\nand there is no simpler expression for this function. It is therefore important not to interpret the second part of the theorem as the definition of the integral. Indeed, there are many functions that are integrable but lack elementary antiderivatives, and discontinuous functions can be integrable but lack any antiderivatives at all. Conversely, many functions that have antiderivatives are not Riemann integrable (see Volterra's function).\n Suppose the following is to be calculated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n2\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\nd\nx\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\int _{2}^{5}x^{2}\\,dx.}\n\n\n Here, \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}}\n\n and we can use \n\n\n\nF\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\n\n1\n3\n\n\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle F(x)={\\frac {1}{3}}x^{3}}\n\n as the antiderivative.

We can relax the conditions on f still further and suppose that it is merely locally integrable. In that case, we can conclude that the function F is differentiable almost everywhere and F\u2032(x) = f(x) almost everywhere. On the real line this statement is equivalent to Lebesgue's differentiation theorem. These results remain true for the Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral, which allows a larger class of integrable functions.[10]\n In higher dimensions Lebesgue's differentiation theorem generalizes the Fundamental theorem of calculus by stating that for almost every x, the average value of a function f over a ball of radius r centered at x tends to f(x) as r tends to 0.\n Part II of the theorem is true for any Lebesgue integrable function f, which has an antiderivative F (not all integrable functions do, though). In other words, if a real function F on [a, b] admits a derivative f(x) at every point x of [a, b] and if this derivative f is Lebesgue integrable on [a, b], then[11]\n\n\n\n\nF\n(\nb\n)\n\u2212\nF\n(\na\n)\n=\n\n\u222b\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\nf\n(\nt\n)\n\nd\nt\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F(b)-F(a)=\\int _{a}^{b}f(t)\\,dt.}\n\n\n This result may fail for continuous functions F that admit a derivative f(x) at almost every point x, as the example of the Cantor function shows. However, if F is absolutely continuous, it admits a derivative F\u2032(x) at almost every point x, and moreover F\u2032 is integrable, with F(b) \u2212 F(a) equal to the integral of F\u2032 on [a, b]. Conversely, if f is any integrable function, then F as given in the first formula will be absolutely continuous with F\u2032 = f almost everywhere.\n The conditions of this theorem may again be relaxed by considering the integrals involved as Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integrals. Specifically, if a continuous function F(x) admits a derivative f(x) at all but countably many points, then f(x) is Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integrable and F(b) \u2212 F(a) is equal to the integral of f on [a, b]. The difference here is that the integrability of f does not need to be assumed.[12]\n The version of Taylor's theorem, which expresses the error term as an integral, can be seen as a generalization of the fundamental theorem.\n There is a version of the theorem for complex functions: suppose U is an open set in C and f\u00a0: U \u2192 C is a function that has a holomorphic antiderivative F on U. Then for every curve \u03b3\u00a0: [a, b] \u2192 U, the curve integral can be computed as\n\n\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\u03b3\n\n\nf\n(\nz\n)\n\nd\nz\n=\nF\n(\n\u03b3\n(\nb\n)\n)\n\u2212\nF\n(\n\u03b3\n(\na\n)\n)\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\int _{\\gamma }f(z)\\,dz=F(\\gamma (b))-F(\\gamma (a)).}\n\n\n The fundamental theorem can be generalized to curve and surface integrals in higher dimensions and on manifolds. One such generalization offered by the calculus of moving surfaces is the time evolution of integrals. The most familiar extensions of the fundamental theorem of calculus in higher dimensions are the divergence theorem and the gradient theorem.\n One of the most powerful generalizations in this direction is Stokes' theorem (sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of multivariable calculus):[13] Let M be an oriented piecewise smooth manifold of dimension n and let \n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\n be a smooth compactly supported (n\u2009\u2212\u20091)-form on M.

        "the first person OR my first step",
        "\n Apollo 11 (July 16\u201324, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5\u00a0kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia.\n Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages\u2014a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\n After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.\n Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. He described the event as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo 11 effectively proved U.S. victory in the Space Race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, \"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"[16]\n In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet Union.[17] On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims of military, economic, and technological superiority.[18] This precipitated the Sputnik crisis, and triggered the Space Race to prove which superpower would achieve superior spaceflight capability.[19] President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded to the Sputnik challenge by creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and initiating Project Mercury,[20] which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit.[21] But on April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth.[22] Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space, completing a 15-minute suborbital journey. After being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, he received a congratulatory telephone call from Eisenhower's successor, John F. Kennedy.[23]\n Since the Soviet Union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles, Kennedy chose, from among options presented by NASA, a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, so that the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this purpose.[24]\n \nOn May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the United States Congress on \"Urgent National Needs\" and declared: I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations\u2014explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the Moon\u2014if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.  On September 12, 1962, Kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about 40,000 people in the Rice University football stadium in Houston, Texas.[26][27] A widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows:\n There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?\nWe choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon\u00a0... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.[28] In spite of that, the proposed program faced the opposition of many Americans and was dubbed a \"moondoggle\" by Norbert Wiener, a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[29][30] The effort to land a man on the Moon already had a name: Project Apollo.[31] When Kennedy met with Nikita Khrushchev, the Premier of the Soviet Union in June 1961, he proposed making the Moon landing a joint project, but Khrushchev did not take up the offer.[32] Kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to the Moon in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 20, 1963.[33] The idea of a joint Moon mission was abandoned after Kennedy's death.[34]\n An early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and Earth orbit rendezvous. A space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up. In July 1962 NASA head James Webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used[35][36] and that the Apollo spacecraft would have three major parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages\u2014a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.[37] This design meant the spacecraft could be launched by a single Saturn V rocket that was then under development.[38]\n Technologies and techniques required for Apollo were developed by Project Gemini.[39] The Apollo project was enabled by NASA's adoption of new advances in semiconductor electronic technology, including metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP)[40][41] and silicon integrated circuit (IC) chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC).[42]\n Project Apollo was abruptly halted by the Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967, in which astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee died, and the subsequent investigation.[43] In October 1968, Apollo 7 evaluated the command module in Earth orbit,[44] and in December Apollo 8 tested it in lunar orbit.[45] In March 1969, Apollo 9 put the lunar module through its paces in Earth orbit,[46] and in May Apollo 10 conducted a \"dress rehearsal\" in lunar orbit. By July 1969, all was in readiness for Apollo 11 to take the final step onto the Moon.[47]\n The Soviet Union appeared  to be winning the Space Race by beating the US to firsts, but its early lead was overtaken by the US Gemini program and Soviet failure to develop the N1 launcher, which would have been comparable to the Saturn V.[48] The Soviets tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of uncrewed probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[49]\n The initial crew assignment of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) Buzz Aldrin on the backup crew for Apollo\u00a09 was officially announced on November 20, 1967.[50] Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of Gemini 12. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo\u00a08 and Apollo\u00a09 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo\u00a08. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.[51]\n There would be one change. Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo\u00a08 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.[52] Lovell took his place on the Apollo\u00a08 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.[53] Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience,[54] the first being Apollo 10.[55] The next was STS-26 in 1988.[54]\n Deke Slayton gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually Apollo 13).[56]\n The Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of Apollo 12. Instead, they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin's attempts to create a more personal relationship.[57] Aldrin and Collins described the crew as \"amiable strangers\".[58] Armstrong did not agree with the assessment, and said \"...\u00a0all the crews I was on worked very well together.\"[58]\n The backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander, William Anders as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo\u00a08.[54] In early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the National Aeronautics and Space Council effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable.[59]\n By the normal crew rotation in place during Apollo, Lovell, Mattingly, and Haise were scheduled to fly on Apollo 14, but the three of them were bumped to Apollo 13: there was a crew issue for Apollo 13 as none of them except Edgar Mitchell flew in space again. George Mueller rejected the crew and this was the first time an Apollo crew was rejected. To give Shepard more training time, Lovell's crew were bumped to Apollo 13. Mattingly would later be replaced by Jack Swigert as CMP on Apollo 13. [59]\n During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground rules, and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially those for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators, allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them.[60] For Apollo 11, the support crew consisted of Ken Mattingly, Ronald Evans and Bill Pogue.[61]\n The capsule communicator (CAPCOM) was an astronaut at the Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew.[62] For Apollo 11, the CAPCOMs were: Charles Duke, Ronald Evans, Bruce McCandless II, James Lovell, William Anders, Ken Mattingly, Fred Haise, Don L. Lind, Owen K. Garriott and Harrison Schmitt.[61]\n The flight directors for this mission were:[63][64][65][66][67][68]\n Other key personnel who played important roles in the Apollo 11 mission include the following.[69]\n The Apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \"peaceful lunar landing by the United States\". At Lovell's suggestion, he chose the bald eagle, the national bird of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins decided the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural colors, and decided on a blue and gold border. Armstrong was concerned that \"eleven\" would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with \"Apollo 11\",[70] and they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would \"be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\".[71]\n An illustrator at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) did the artwork, which was then sent off to NASA officials for approval.[70] The design was rejected. Bob Gilruth, the director of the MSC felt the talons of the eagle looked \"too warlike\".[72] After some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the talons.[72] When the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.[73] The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979.[74]\n After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to George Low, the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at the MSC, to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. The name Snowcone was used for the CM and Haystack was used for the LM in both internal and external communications during early mission planning.[75]\n The LM was named Eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia. At Scheer's suggestion, the CM was named Columbia after Columbiad, the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft (also from Florida) in Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon. It also referred to Columbia, a historical name of the United States. [76][77] In Collins' 1976 book, he said Columbia was in reference to Christopher Columbus.[78]\n The astronauts had personal preference kits (PPKs), small bags containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on the mission.[79] Five 0.5-pound (0.23\u00a0kg) PPKs were carried on Apollo 11: three (one for each astronaut) were stowed on Columbia before launch, and two on Eagle.[80]\n Neil Armstrong's LM PPK contained a piece of wood from the Wright brothers' 1903 Wright Flyer's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing,[81] along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Slayton by the widows of the Apollo\u00a01 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to Slayton afterwards, but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton. Armstrong took it with him on Apollo 11.[82]\n NASA's Apollo Site Selection Board announced five potential landing sites on February 8, 1968. These were the result of two years' worth of studies based on high-resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the Lunar Orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the Surveyor program.[83] The best Earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution Project Apollo required.[84] The landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required, clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering, and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar. Scientific value was not a consideration.[85]\n Areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on Earth were often found to be totally unacceptable. The original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed, as no such site was found.[86] Five sites were considered: Sites\u00a01 and\u00a02 were in the Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis); Site\u00a03 was in the Central Bay (Sinus Medii); and Sites\u00a04 and\u00a05 were in the Ocean of Storms (Oceanus Procellarum).[83]\nThe final site selection was based on seven criteria:\n The requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month.[83] A landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience.[87] The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site\u00a02, with Sites 3\u00a0and\u00a05 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed. In May 1969, Apollo 10's lunar module flew to within 15 kilometers (9.3\u00a0mi) of Site\u00a02, and reported it was acceptable.[88][89]\n During the first press conference after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question was, \"Which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface?\"[90][91] Slayton told the reporter it had not been decided, and Armstrong added that it was \"not based on individual desire\".[90]\n One of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander, which matched what had been done on Gemini missions,[92] where the commander had never performed the spacewalk.[93] Reporters wrote in early 1969 that Aldrin would be the first man to walk on the Moon, and Associate Administrator George Mueller told reporters he would be first as well. Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.[94]\n For decades, Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar module's hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring.[95] Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said, \"Yes, that's the way to do it.\"[96]\n The media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander's prerogative to exit the spacecraft first.[97] Chris Kraft revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon. They argued that the first person to walk on the Moon should be like Charles Lindbergh, a calm and quiet person. They made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft.[98]\n The ascent stage of LM-5 Eagle arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on January 8, 1969, followed by the descent stage four days later, and CSM-107 Columbia on January 23.[6] There were several differences between Eagle and Apollo 10's LM-4 Snoopy; Eagle had a VHF radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their EVA on the lunar surface; a lighter ascent engine; more thermal protection on the landing gear; and a package of scientific experiments known as the Early Apollo Scientific Experiments Package (EASEP). The only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch.[99][100] The CSM was mated on January 29, and moved from the Operations and Checkout Building to the Vehicle Assembly Building on April 14.[6]\n The S-IVB third stage of Saturn V AS-506 had arrived on January 18, followed by the S-II second stage on February 6, S-IC first stage on February 20, and the Saturn V Instrument Unit on February 27. At 12:30 on May 20, the 5,443-tonne (5,357-long-ton; 6,000-short-ton) assembly departed the Vehicle Assembly Building atop the crawler-transporter, bound for Launch Pad 39A, part of Launch Complex 39, while Apollo 10 was still on its way to the Moon. A countdown test commenced on June 26, and concluded on July 2. The launch complex was floodlit on the night of July 15, when the crawler-transporter carried the mobile service structure back to its parking area.[6] In the early hours of the morning, the fuel tanks of the S-II and S-IVB stages were filled with liquid hydrogen.[101] Fueling was completed by three hours before launch.[102] Launch operations were partly automated, with 43 programs written in the ATOLL programming language.[103]\n Slayton roused the crew shortly after 04:00, and they showered, shaved, and had the traditional pre-flight breakfast of steak and eggs with Slayton and the backup crew. They then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen. At 06:30, they headed out to Launch Complex 39.[104] Haise entered Columbia about three hours and ten minutes before launch time. Along with a technician, he helped Armstrong into the left-hand couch at 06:54. Five minutes later, Collins joined him, taking up his position on the right-hand couch. Finally, Aldrin entered, taking the center couch.[102] Haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch.[105] The closeout crew sealed the hatch, and the cabin was purged and pressurized. The closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time. The countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time.[102] Over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the firing room.[101]\n An estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site. Dignitaries included the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General William Westmoreland, four cabinet members, 19 state governors, 40 mayors, 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen. Vice President Spiro Agnew viewed the launch with former president Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson.[101][106] Around 3,500 media representatives were present.[107] About two-thirds were from the United States; the rest came from 55 other countries. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25\u00a0million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts.[106][101] President Richard Nixon viewed the launch from his office in the White House with his NASA liaison officer, Apollo astronaut Frank Borman.[108]\n Saturn V AS-506 launched Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 EDT).[6] At 13.2 seconds into the flight, the launch vehicle began to roll into its flight azimuth of 72.058\u00b0. Full shutdown of the first-stage engines occurred about 2\u00a0minutes and 42 seconds into the mission, followed by separation of the S-IC and ignition of the S-II engines. The second stage engines then cut off and separated at about 9\u00a0minutes and 8\u00a0seconds, allowing the first ignition of the S-IVB engine a few seconds later.[8]\n Apollo 11 entered a near-circular Earth orbit at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles (185.9\u00a0km) by 98.9 nautical miles (183.2\u00a0km), twelve minutes into its flight. After one and a half orbits, a second ignition of the S-IVB engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left seat and at the controls, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed. This involved separating Columbia from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with Eagle still attached to the stage. After the LM was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.[109][8] This was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft, the Earth, or the Moon. A slingshot effect from passing around the Moon threw it into an orbit around the Sun.[110]\n On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit.[8][111] In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of the crater Sabine D. The site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers and the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft, and because it was unlikely to present major landing or EVA challenges.[112] It lay about 25 kilometers (16\u00a0mi) southeast of the Surveyor\u00a05 landing site, and 68 kilometers (42\u00a0mi) southwest of Ranger\u00a08's crash site.[113]\n At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered Eagle, and began the final preparations for lunar descent.[8] At 17:44:00 Eagle separated from Columbia.[13] Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged, and that the landing gear was correctly deployed.[114][115] Armstrong exclaimed: \"The Eagle has wings!\"[115]\n As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early, and reported that they were \"long\"; they would land miles west of their target point. Eagle was traveling too fast. The problem could have been mascons\u2014concen\u00adtra\u00adtions of high mass in a region or regions of the Moon's crust that contains a gravitational anomaly, potentially altering Eagle's trajectory. Flight Director Gene Kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel, or a result of Eagle's pirouette maneuver.[116][117]\n Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800\u00a0m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM guidance computer (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center, computer engineer Jack Garman told Guidance Officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \"executive overflows\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks in real-time and had to postpone some of them.[118][119] Margaret Hamilton, the Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming at the MIT Charles Stark Draper Laboratory later recalled:\n To blame the computer for the Apollo 11 problems is like blaming the person who spots a fire and calls the fire department. Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones. The computer, rather than almost forcing an abort, prevented an abort. If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it was.[120] During the mission, the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position, causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time.[121][122] Software engineer Don Eyles concluded in a 2005 Guidance and Control Conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed LM in Apollo 5. Having the rendezvous radar on (so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort) should have been irrelevant to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up. The extra spurious cycle stealing, as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.[123]\n When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-foot-diameter (91\u00a0m) crater (later determined to be West crater), so he took semi-automatic control.[124][125] Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high. Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting Eagle. Now 107 feet (33\u00a0m) above the surface, Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site.[126]\n Armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it. As he got closer, now 250 feet (76\u00a0m) above the surface, he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it. He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground. They were now 100 feet (30\u00a0m) from the surface, with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining. Lunar dust kicked up by the LM's engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecraft's motion. Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud, and Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft's speed.[127]\n A light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170\u00a0cm) probes hanging from Eagle's footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said: \"Contact light!\" Armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down, as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engine's own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode, but he forgot. Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong shut the engine down.[128] Aldrin immediately said \"Okay, engine stop. ACA\u2014out of detent.\" Armstrong acknowledged: \"Out of detent. Auto.\" Aldrin continued: \"Mode control\u2014both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm\u2014off. 413 is in.\"[129]\n ACA was the Attitude Control Assembly\u2014the LM's control stick. Output went to the LGC to command the reaction control system (RCS) jets to fire. \"Out of Detent\" meant the stick had moved away from its centered position; it was spring-centered like the turn indicator in a car. Address 413 of the Abort Guidance System (AGS) contained the variable that indicated the LM had landed.[10]\n Eagle landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with 216 pounds (98\u00a0kg) of usable fuel remaining. Information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the LM had enough fuel for another 25 seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe,[10][130] but post-mission analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to 50 seconds.[131] Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of the propellant sloshing more than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.[10]\n Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post-landing checklist with \"Engine arm is off\", before responding to the CAPCOM, Charles Duke, with the words, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\" Armstrong's unrehearsed change of call sign from \"Eagle\" to \"Tranquility Base\" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful.[132] Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: \"Roger, Twan\u2014Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\"[10][133]\n Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\n This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.[134] He then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo\u00a08 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. For this reason, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.[135] The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but they chose to begin preparations for the EVA early, thinking they would be unable to sleep.[136]\n Preparations for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the Moon began at 23:43 UTC.[13] These took longer than expected; three and a half hours instead of two.[137] During training on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well, such as checklists, food packets, and tools.[138] Six hours and thirty-nine minutes after landing Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, and Eagle was depressurized.[139]\n Eagle's hatch was opened at 02:39:33.[13] Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system (PLSS).[137] Some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.[140] At 02:51 Armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface. The remote control unit on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle's side and activate the TV camera.[141][15]\n Apollo 11 used slow-scan television (TV) incompatible with broadcast TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor (thus, a broadcast of a broadcast), significantly reducing the quality of the picture.[142] The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States, but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia.[143] Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600\u00a0million people on Earth.[143] Copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.[142]\n After describing the surface dust as \"very fine-grained\" and \"almost like a powder\",[15] at 02:56:15,[144] six and a half hours after landing, Armstrong stepped off Eagle's landing pad and declared: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][145][146]\n Armstrong intended to say \"That's one small step for a man\", but the word \"a\" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said \"for a man\", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the \"a\" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \"for a\" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. A more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \"a\" may have been spoken but obscured by static. Other analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as \"face-saving fabrication\", and that Armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line.[147][148][149]\n About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.[150] Twelve minutes after the sample was collected,[145] he removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod.[137] The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. Still photography was accomplished with a Hasselblad camera that could be operated hand-held or mounted on Armstrong's Apollo space suit.[151] Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface. He described the view with the simple phrase: \"Magnificent desolation.\"[15]\n Armstrong said moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was \"even perhaps easier than the simulations\u00a0... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.\"[15] Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, but the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.[15] The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust, which soiled the outer part of their suits.[151]\n The astronauts planted the Lunar Flag Assembly containing a flag of the United States on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, \"Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising.\"[152] But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole about 2 inches (5\u00a0cm) into the hard lunar surface. Aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of TV viewers, but gave \"a crisp West Point salute\".[152] Before Aldrin could take a photo of Armstrong with the flag, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission, which Nixon called \"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\"[153] Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief.[154]\n Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you have done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure that they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth. Armstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and a curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.[155][156] They deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment.[157] Then Armstrong walked 196 feet (60\u00a0m) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core samples. He used the geologist's hammer to pound in the tubes\u2014the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11\u2014but was unable to penetrate more than 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) deep. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes. Aldrin shoveled 6 kilograms (13\u00a0lb) of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly.[158] Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: basalt and breccia.[159] Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. All have subsequently been found on Earth.[160]\n While on the surface, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM ladder, bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\n Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969, A. D. We came in peace for all mankind.[15] At the behest of the Nixon administration to add a reference to God, NASA included the vague date as a reason to include A.D., which stands for Anno Domini, \"in the year of our Lord\" (although it should have been placed before the year, not after).[161]\n Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong his metabolic rates were high, and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. As metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.[157] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.[162]\n Aldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5\u00a0lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC). This proved to be an inefficient tool, and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand.[137] Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto the ladder's third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:11:13. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.[163]\n Presidential speech writer William Safire had prepared an In Event of Moon Disaster announcement for Nixon to read in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.[164] The remarks were in a memo from Safire to Nixon's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.[165][166] According to the plan, Mission Control would \"close down communications\" with the LM, and a clergyman would \"commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke's World War I poem \"The Soldier\".[166]\n While moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for liftoff from the Moon. There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. The nonconductive tip of a Duro felt-tip pen[167] was sufficient to activate the switch.[163]\n After more than 21+1\u20442 hours on the lunar surface, in addition to the scientific instruments, the astronauts left behind: an Apollo 1 mission patch in memory of astronauts\u00a0Roger Chaffee, Gus Grissom, and Edward White, who died when their command module caught fire during a test in January 1967; two memorial medals of Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin, who died in 1967 and 1968 respectively; a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace; and a silicon message disk carrying the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon along with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world.[168] The disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and then-current top management.[169]\n After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54:00 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.[145] Film taken from the LM ascent stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some 25 feet (8\u00a0m) from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple: \"The ascent stage of the LM separated\u00a0... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\"[170] Subsequent Apollo missions planted their flags farther from the LM.[171]\n During his day flying solo around the Moon, Collins never felt lonely. Although it has been said \"not since Adam has any human known such solitude\",[172] Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his autobiography he wrote: \"this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two\".[172] In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while Columbia passed round the far side of the Moon, the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness, but rather \"awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation\".[172]\n One of Collins' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return.[173]\n Just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of Columbia might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When Columbia came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of orbits, he described his time on the back side of the Moon as \"relaxing\". After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for Eagle to meet up with Columbia, Collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly Columbia down to meet Eagle.[174]\n Eagle rendezvoused with Columbia at 21:24 UTC on July 21, and the two docked at 21:35. Eagle's ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 23:41.[9] Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle's orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \"uncertain location\" on the lunar surface.[175] In 2021, however, some calculations show that the lander may still be in orbit.[176]\n \nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented:  \u00a0... The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly\u00a0... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people\u00a0... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \"Thank you very much.\"[177] \nAldrin added:  This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown\u00a0... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. \"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\"[177][178] \nArmstrong concluded:  The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.[177]  On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg was later thanked by Armstrong.[179]\n The aircraft carrier USS\u00a0Hornet, under the command of Captain Carl J. Seiberlich,[180] was selected as the primary recovery ship (PRS) for Apollo 11 on June 5, replacing its sister ship, the LPH USS\u00a0Princeton, which had recovered Apollo 10 on May 26. Hornet was then at her home port of Long Beach, California.[181] On reaching Pearl Harbor on July 5, Hornet embarked the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopters of HS-4, a unit which specialized in recovery of Apollo spacecraft, specialized divers of UDT Detachment Apollo, a 35-man NASA recovery team, and about 120 media representatives. To make room, most of Hornet's air wing was left behind in Long Beach. Special recovery equipment was also loaded, including a boilerplate command module used for training.[182]\n On July 12, with Apollo 11 still on the launch pad, Hornet departed Pearl Harbor for the recovery area in the central Pacific,[183] in the vicinity of 10\u00b036\u2032N 172\u00b024\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff10.600\u00b0N 172.400\u00b0E\ufeff / 10.600; 172.400.[184] A presidential party consisting of Nixon, Borman, Secretary of State William P. Rogers and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger flew to Johnston Atoll on Air Force One, then to the command ship USS Arlington in Marine One. After a night on board, they would fly to Hornet in Marine One for a few hours of ceremonies. On arrival aboard Hornet, the party was greeted by the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC), Admiral John S. McCain Jr., and NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, who flew to Hornet from Pago Pago in one of Hornet's carrier onboard delivery aircraft.[185]\n Weather satellites were not yet common, but US Air Force Captain Hank Brandli had access to top-secret spy satellite images. He realized that a storm front was headed for the Apollo recovery area. Poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult, and strong upper-level winds which \"would have ripped their parachutes to shreds\" according to Brandli, posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission.[186] Brandli alerted Navy Captain Willard S. Houston Jr., the commander of the Fleet Weather Center at Pearl Harbor, who had the required security clearance. On their recommendation, Rear Admiral Donald C. Davis, commander of Manned Spaceflight Recovery Forces, Pacific, advised NASA to change the recovery area, each man risking his career. A new location was selected 215 nautical miles (398\u00a0km) northeast.[187][188]\n This altered the flight plan. A different sequence of computer programs was used, one never before attempted. In a conventional entry, trajectory event P64 was followed by P67. For a skip-out re-entry, P65 and P66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip. In this case, because they were extending the re-entry but not actually skipping out, P66 was not invoked and instead, P65 led directly to P67. The crew were also warned they would not be in a full-lift (heads-down) attitude when they entered P67.[187] The first program's acceleration subjected the astronauts to 6.5 standard gravities (64\u00a0m/s2); the second, to 6.0 standard gravities (59\u00a0m/s2).[189]\n Before dawn on July 24, Hornet launched four Sea King helicopters and three Grumman E-1 Tracers. Two of the E-1s were designated as \"air boss\" while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft. Two of the Sea Kings carried divers and recovery equipment. The third carried photographic equipment, and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon.[190] At 16:44 UTC (05:44 local time) Columbia's drogue parachutes were deployed. This was observed by the helicopters. Seven minutes later Columbia struck the water forcefully 2,660\u00a0km (1,440\u00a0nmi) east of Wake Island, 380\u00a0km (210\u00a0nmi) south of Johnston Atoll, and 24\u00a0km (13\u00a0nmi) from Hornet,[9][187] at 13\u00b019\u2032N 169\u00b09\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff13.317\u00b0N 169.150\u00b0W\ufeff / 13.317; -169.150.[191] 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) with 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) seas and winds at 17 knots (31\u00a0km/h; 20\u00a0mph) from the east were reported under broken clouds at 1,500 feet (460\u00a0m) with visibility of 10 nautical miles (19\u00a0km; 12\u00a0mi) at the recovery site.[192] Reconnaissance aircraft flying to the original splashdown location reported the conditions Brandli and Houston had predicted.[193]\n During splashdown, Columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts.[194] A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting.[195] More divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction.[196]\n The divers then passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, but NASA took precautions at the recovery site. The astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and Columbia wiped with Povidone-iodine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter. BIGs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board Hornet. The raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk.[194]\n After touchdown on Hornet at 17:53 UTC, the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay, where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) to the Mobile quarantine facility (MQF), where they would begin the Earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine.[197] This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life, and the quarantine process dropped.[198][199] Nixon welcomed the astronauts back to Earth. He told them: \"[A]s a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.\"[200]\n After Nixon departed, Hornet was brought alongside the 5-short-ton (4.5\u00a0t) Columbia, which was lifted aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. It was then attached to the MQF with a flexible tunnel, allowing the lunar samples, film, data tapes and other items to be removed. Hornet returned to Pearl Harbor, where the MQF was loaded onto a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter and airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center. The astronauts arrived at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at 10:00 UTC on July 28. Columbia was taken to Ford Island for deactivation, and its pyrotechnics made safe. It was then taken to Hickham Air Force Base, from whence it was flown to Houston in a Douglas C-133 Cargomaster, reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July 30.[201]\n In accordance with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol,[202] the astronauts continued in quarantine. After three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.[203] On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki),[204] and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.[205]\n On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees.[206][207] On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger and his predecessor, Earl Warren, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel. Nixon and Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[206][208]\n The three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on September 16, 1969. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that they had carried with them to the surface of the Moon.[209] The flag of American Samoa on Apollo 11 is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa.[210]\n This celebration began a 38-day world tour that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries.[211] The crew toured from September 29 to November 5.[211][212][213] Many nations honored the first human Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.[214]\n Humans walking on the Moon and returning safely to Earth accomplished Kennedy's goal set eight years earlier. In Mission Control during the Apollo 11 landing, Kennedy's speech flashed on the screen, followed by the words \"TASK ACCOMPLISHED, July 1969\".[215] The success of Apollo 11 demonstrated the United States' technological superiority;[215] and with the success of Apollo 11, America had won the Space Race.[216][217]\n New phrases permeated into the English language. \"If they can send a man to the Moon, why can't they\u00a0...?\" became a common saying following Apollo 11.[218] Armstrong's words on the lunar surface also spun off various parodies.[216]\n While most people celebrated the accomplishment, disenfranchised Americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in America, evidenced by protesters led by Ralph Abernathy outside of Kennedy Space Center the day before Apollo 11 launched.[219] NASA Administrator Thomas Paine met with Abernathy at the occasion, both hoping that the space program can spur progress also in other regards, such as poverty in the US.[220] Paine was then asked, and agreed, to host protesters as spectators at the launch,[220] and Abernathy, awestruck by the spectacle,[107] prayed for the astronauts.[220] Racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the Apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on Earth. A poem by Gil Scott-Heron called \"Whitey on the Moon\" (1970) illustrated the racial inequality in the United States that was highlighted by the Space Race.[216][221][222] The poem starts with:\n A rat done bit my sister Nell.\n(with Whitey on the moon)\nHer face and arms began to swell.\n(and Whitey's on the moon)\nI can't pay no doctor bill.\n(but Whitey's on the moon)\nTen years from now I'll be paying still.\n(while Whitey's on the moon)\n[...][222]\n Twenty percent of the world's population watched humans walk on the Moon for the first time. While Apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world, the follow-on Apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation.[215] One possible explanation was the shift in complexity. Landing someone on the Moon was an easy goal to understand; lunar geology was too abstract for the average person. Another is that Kennedy's goal of landing humans on the Moon had already been accomplished.[223] A well-defined objective helped Project Apollo accomplish its goal, but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions.[224][225]\n While most Americans were proud of their nation's achievements in space exploration, only once during the late 1960s did the Gallup Poll indicate that a majority of Americans favored \"doing more\" in space as opposed to \"doing less\". By 1973, 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration. The Space Race had been won, and Cold War tensions were easing as the US and Soviet Union entered the era of d\u00e9tente. This was also a time when inflation was rising, which put pressure on the government to reduce spending. What saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great. Drastic cuts, warned Caspar Weinberger, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, might send a signal that \"our best years are behind us\".[226]\n After the Apollo 11 mission, officials from the Soviet Union said landing humans on the Moon was dangerous and unnecessary. At the time the Soviet Union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically. The Soviets publicly denied there was a race to the Moon, and indicated they were not making an attempt.[227] Mstislav Keldysh said in July 1969, \"We are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems.\" It was revealed in 1989 that the Soviets had tried to send people to the Moon, but were unable due to technological difficulties.[228] The public's reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it.[229]\n The Apollo 11 landing is referenced in the songs \"Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins\" by The Byrds on the 1969 album Ballad of Easy Rider and \"Coon on the Moon\" by Howlin' Wolf on the 1973 album The Back Door Wolf.\n The command module Columbia went on a tour of the United States, visiting 49 state capitals, the District of Columbia, and Anchorage, Alaska.[230] In 1971, it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution, and was displayed at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in Washington, DC.[231] It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, Spirit of St. Louis, Bell X-1, North American X-15 and Friendship 7.[232]\n Columbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This included Space Center Houston from October 14, 2017, to March 18, 2018, the Saint Louis Science Center from April 14 to September 3, 2018, the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh from September 29, 2018, to February 18, 2019, and its last location at Museum of Flight in Seattle from March 16 to September 2, 2019.[231][233] Continued renovations at the Smithsonian allowed time for an additional stop for the capsule, and it was moved to the Cincinnati Museum Center. The ribbon cutting ceremony was on September 29, 2019.[234]\n For 40 years Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits were displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit,[235] until it permanently closed on December 3, 2018, to be replaced by a new gallery which was scheduled to open in 2022. A special display of Armstrong's suit was unveiled for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 in July 2019.[236][237] The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar and the flotation bags are in the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia, where they are on display along with a test lunar module.[238][239][240]\n The descent stage of the LM Eagle remains on the Moon. In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.[241] The remains of the ascent stage lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface, after being abandoned and impacting the Moon. The location is uncertain because Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time.[242]\n In March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines from the S-IC stage that launched Apollo 11 into space. They were found on the Atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning.[243] His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from Apollo 11.[244][245] The S-IVB third stage which performed Apollo 11's trans-lunar injection remains in a solar orbit near to that of Earth.[246]\n The main repository for the Apollo Moon rocks is the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. For safekeeping, there is also a smaller collection stored at White Sands Test Facility near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture. They are handled only indirectly, using special tools. Over 100 research laboratories worldwide conduct studies of the samples; approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year.[247][248]\n In November 1969, Nixon asked NASA to make up about 250 presentation Apollo 11 lunar sample displays for 135 nations, the fifty states of the United States and its possessions, and the United Nations. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11 and flags, including the one of the Soviet Union, taken along by Apollo 11. The rice-sized particles were four small pieces of Moon soil weighing about 50\u00a0mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a United States half dollar coin. This acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust. Nixon gave the Apollo 11 lunar sample displays as goodwill gifts in 1970.[249][250]\n The Passive Seismic Experiment ran until the command uplink failed on August 25, 1969. The downlink failed on December 14, 1969.[251] As of 2018[update], the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment remains operational.[252]\n Armstrong's Hasselblad camera was thought to be lost or left on the Moon surface.[253]\n In 2015, after Armstrong died in 2012, his widow contacted the National Air and Space Museum to inform them she had found a white cloth bag in one of Armstrong's closets. The bag contained various items, which should have been left behind in the lunar module, including the 16mm Data Acquisition Camera that had been used to capture images of the first Moon landing.[254][255] The camera is currently on display at the National Air and Space Museum.[256]\n On July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.[257] From July 16 to 24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.[258] It is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.[259] In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronized and released for the first time.[260] The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up an Adobe Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.[261]\n On July 20, 2009, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with US President Barack Obama at the White House.[262] \"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\", Obama said. \"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\"[263] On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Senator Bill Nelson and Florida Representative Alan Grayson.[264][265]\n A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\n It was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken\u00a0... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today\u00a0... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date\u00a0... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts\u2014Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.[266] On June 10, 2015, Congressman Bill Posey introduced resolution H.R. 2726 to the 114th session of the United States House of Representatives directing the United States Mint to design and sell commemorative coins in gold, silver and clad for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. On January 24, 2019, the Mint released the Apollo 11 Fiftieth Anniversary commemorative coins to the public on its website.[267][268]\n A documentary film, Apollo 11, with restored footage of the 1969 event, premiered in IMAX on March 1, 2019, and broadly in theaters on March 8.[269][270]\n The Smithsonian Institute's National Air and Space Museum and NASA sponsored the \"Apollo 50 Festival\" on the National Mall in Washington DC. The three day (July 18 to 20, 2019) outdoor festival featured hands-on exhibits and activities, live performances, and speakers such as Adam Savage and NASA scientists.[271]\n As part of the festival, a projection of the 363-foot (111\u00a0m) tall Saturn V rocket was displayed on the east face of the 555-foot (169\u00a0m) tall Washington Monument from July 16 through the 20th from 9:30\u00a0pm until 11:30\u00a0pm (EDT). The program also included a 17-minute show that combined full-motion video projected on the Washington Monument to recreate the assembly and launch of the Saturn V rocket. The projection was joined by a 40-foot (12\u00a0m) wide recreation of the Kennedy Space Center countdown clock and two large video screens showing archival footage to recreate the time leading up to the moon landing. There were three shows per night on July 19\u201320, with the last show on Saturday, delayed slightly so the portion where Armstrong first set foot on the Moon would happen exactly 50 years to the second after the actual event.[272]\n On July 19, 2019, the Google Doodle paid tribute to the Apollo 11 Moon Landing, complete with a link to an animated YouTube video with voiceover by astronaut Michael Collins.[273][274]\n Aldrin, Collins, and Armstrong's sons were hosted by President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.[275][276]\n In some of the following sources, times are shown in the format hours:minutes:seconds (e.g. 109:24:15), referring to the mission's Ground Elapsed Time (GET),[284] based on the official launch time of July 16, 1969, 13:32:00 UTC (000:00:00 GET).[105][6]\n"

When it comes to governmental and business use cases, OpenDocument signatures can protect the integrity of a document's content, for example, for contracts, amendments, or bills. Moreover OpenDocument signatures also protect document's macros. Since the risks of using macros in documents is well-known, modern office applications only enable their execution if a trusted entity signs the macro code. Thus, the security of ODF documents often depends on the correct signature verification. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of OpenDocument signatures and reveal numerous severe threats. We identified five new attacks and evaluated them against 16 office applications on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and two online services. Our investigation revealed 12 out of 18 applications to be vulnerable for macro code execution, although the application only executes macros signed by trusted entities. For 17 of 18 applications, we could spoof the content in a signed ODF document while keeping the signature valid and trusted. Finally, we showed that attackers possessing a signed ODF could alter and forge the signature creation time in 16 of 18 applications.

        "gravity AND gravity",
        "Gravity is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its center. The force of gravity keeps all of the planets in orbit around the sun. Why do you land on the ground when you jump up instead of floating off into space? Why do things fall down when you throw them or drop them? The answer is gravity: an invisible force that pulls objects toward each other. Earth's gravity is what keeps you on the ground and what makes things fall. An animation of gravity at work. Albert Einstein described gravity as a curve in space that wraps around an object\u2014such as a star or a planet. If another object is nearby, it is pulled into the curve. Image credit: NASA Anything that has mass also has gravity. Objects with more mass have more gravity. Gravity also gets weaker with distance. So, the closer objects are to each other, the stronger their gravitational pull is. Earth's gravity comes from all its mass. All its mass makes a combined gravitational pull on all the mass in your body. That's what gives you weight. And if you were on a planet with less mass than Earth, you would weigh less than you do here. Image credit: NASA You exert the same gravitational force on Earth that it does on you. But because Earth is so much more massive than you, your force doesn\u2019t really have an effect on our planet. Gravity is what holds the planets in orbit around the sun and what keeps the moon in orbit around Earth. The gravitational pull of the moon pulls the seas towards it, causing the ocean tides. Gravity creates stars and planets by pulling together the material from which they are made. Gravity not only pulls on mass but also on light. Albert Einstein discovered this principle. If you shine a flashlight upwards, the light will grow imperceptibly redder as gravity pulls it. You can't see the change with your eyes, but scientists can measure it. Black holes pack so much mass into such a small volume that their gravity is strong enough to keep anything, even light, from escaping. Watch this video to find out more about these areas of immense gravity! Gravity is very important to us. We could not live on Earth without it. The sun's gravity keeps Earth in orbit around it, keeping us at a comfortable distance to enjoy the sun's light and warmth. It holds down our atmosphere and the air we need to breathe. Gravity is what holds our world together.   However, gravity isn\u2019t the same everywhere on Earth. Gravity is slightly stronger over places with more mass underground than over places with less mass. NASA uses two spacecraft to measure these variations in Earth\u2019s gravity.  These spacecraft are part of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. The GRACE mission helps scientists to create maps of gravity variations on Earth. Areas in blue have slightly weaker gravity and areas in red have slightly stronger gravity. Image credit: NASA/University of Texas Center for Space Research GRACE detects tiny changes in gravity over time. These changes have revealed important details about our planet. For example, GRACE monitors changes in sea level and can detect changes in Earth\u2019s crust brought on by earthquakes. What is a black hole? What is a gravitational wave? What is a barycenter?

        "gravity AND gravity",
        "\n \n In physics, gravity (from Latin  gravitas\u00a0'weight'[1]) is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy[clarification needed]. Gravity is, by far, the weakest of the four fundamental interactions, approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction, 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction. As a result, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles.[2] However, gravity is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light.\n On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity is responsible for sublunar tides in the oceans (the corresponding antipodal tide is caused by the inertia of the Earth and Moon orbiting one another). Gravity also has many important biological functions, helping to guide the growth of plants through the process of gravitropism and influencing the circulation of fluids in multicellular organisms. Investigation into the effects of weightlessness has shown that gravity may play a role in immune system function and cell differentiation within the human body.\n The gravitational attraction between the original gaseous matter in the universe caused it to coalesce and form stars which eventually condensed into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.\n Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity (proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915), which describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing\u2014not even light\u2014can escape once past the black hole's event horizon.[3] However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:\n\n\n\n\nF\n=\nG\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F=G{\\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}},}\n\nwhere F is the force, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects interacting, r is the distance between the centers of the masses and G is the gravitational constant.\n Current models of particle physics imply that the earliest instance of gravity in the universe, possibly in the form of quantum gravity, supergravity or a gravitational singularity, along with ordinary space and time, developed during the Planck epoch (up to 10\u221243 seconds after the birth of the universe), possibly from a primeval state, such as a false vacuum, quantum vacuum or virtual particle, in a currently unknown manner.[4] Scientists are currently working to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics, a quantum gravity theory,[5] which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical framework (a theory of everything) with the other three fundamental interactions of physics.\n Gravitation is the mutual attraction between all masses in the universe, also known as gravitational attraction. Gravity is the gravitational attraction at the surface of a planet or other celestial body.[6]\n The nature and mechanism of gravity was explored by a wide range of ancient scholars. In Greece, Aristotle believed that objects fell towards the Earth because the Earth was the center of the Universe and attracted all of the mass in the Universe towards it. He also thought that the speed of a falling object should increase with its weight, a conclusion which was later shown to be false.[7] While Aristotle's view was widely accepted throughout Ancient Greece, there were other thinkers such as Plutarch who correctly predicted that the attraction of gravity was not unique to the Earth.[8]\n Although he didn't understand gravity as a force, the ancient Greek philosopher Archimedes discovered the center of gravity of a triangle.[9] He also postulated that if two equal weights did not have the same center of gravity, the center of gravity of the two weights together would be in the middle of the line that joins their centers of gravity.[10] Two centuries later, the Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius contended in his De architectura that gravity is not dependent on a substance's weight but rather on its \"nature\".[11]\nIn the 6th century CE, the Byzantine Alexandrian scholar John Philoponus proposed the theory of impetus, which modifies Aristotle's theory that \"continuation of motion depends on continued action of a force\" by incorporating a causative force which diminishes over time.\n In India in the seventh century CE, Brahmagupta proposed the idea that gravity is an attractive force which draws objects to the Earth and used the term gurutv\u0101kar\u1e63a\u1e47 to describe it.[12][13][14]\n In the ancient Middle East, gravity was a topic of fierce debate. The Persian intellectual Al-Biruni believed that the force of gravity was not unique to the Earth, and he correctly assumed that other heavenly bodies should exert a gravitational attraction as well.[15] In contrast, Al-Khazini held the same position as Aristotle that all matter in the Universe is attracted to the center of the Earth.[16]\n In the mid-16th century, various European scientists experimentally disproved the Aristotelian notion that heavier objects fall at a faster rate.[17] In particular, the Spanish Dominican priest Domingo de Soto wrote in 1551 that bodies in free fall uniformly accelerate.[17] De Soto may have been influenced by earlier experiments conducted by other Dominican priests in Italy, including those by Benedetto Varchi, Francesco Beato, Luca Ghini, and Giovan Bellaso which contradicted Aristotle's teachings on the fall of bodies.[17] The mid-16th century Italian physicist Giambattista Benedetti published papers claiming that, due to specific gravity, objects made of the same material but with different masses would fall at the same speed.[18] With the 1586 Delft tower experiment, the Flemish physicist Simon Stevin observed that two cannonballs of differing sizes and weights fell at the same rate when dropped from a tower.[19] Finally, in the late 16th century, Galileo Galilei's careful measurements of balls rolling down inclines allowed him to firmly establish that gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects.[20] Galileo postulated that air resistance is the reason that objects with a low density and high surface area fall more slowly in an atmosphere.\n In 1604, Galileo correctly hypothesized that the distance of a falling object is proportional to the square of the time elapsed.[21] This was later confirmed by Italian scientists Jesuits Grimaldi and Riccioli between 1640 and 1650. They also calculated the magnitude of the Earth's gravity by measuring the oscillations of a pendulum.[22]\n In 1684, Newton sent a manuscript to Edmond Halley titled De motu corporum in gyrum ('On the motion of bodies in an orbit'), which provided a physical justification for Kepler's laws of planetary motion.[23] Halley was impressed by the manuscript and urged Newton to expand on it, and a few years later Newton published a groundbreaking book called Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). In this book, Newton described gravitation as a universal force, and claimed  that \"the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve.\" This statement was later condensed into the following inverse-square law:\n \n\n\n\nF\n=\nG\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F=G{\\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}},}\n\nwhere F is the force, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects interacting, r is the distance between the centers of the masses and G is the gravitational constant 6.674\u00d710\u221211\u00a0m3\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5s\u22122.[24]\n Newton's Principia was well received by the scientific community, and his law of gravitation quickly spread across the European world.[25] More than a century later, in 1821, his theory of gravitation rose to even greater prominence when it was used to predict the existence of Neptune. In that year, the French astronomer Alexis Bouvard used this theory to create a table modeling the orbit of Uranus, which was shown to differ significantly from the planet's actual trajectory. In order to explain this discrepancy, many astronomers speculated that there might be a large object beyond the orbit of Uranus which was disrupting its orbit. In 1846, the astronomers John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier independently used Newton's law to predict Neptune's location in the night sky, and the planet was discovered there within a day.[26]\n Eventually, astronomers noticed an eccentricity in the orbit of the planet Mercury which could not be explained by Newton's theory: the perihelion of the orbit was increasing by about 42.98 arcseconds per century. The most obvious explanation for this discrepancy was an as-yet-undiscovered celestial body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury), but all efforts to find such a body turned out to be fruitless. Finally, in 1915, Albert Einstein developed a theory of general relativity which was able to accurately model Mercury's orbit.[27]\n In general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of a force. Einstein began to toy with this idea in the form of the equivalence principle, a discovery which he later described as \"the happiest thought of my life.\"[28] In this theory, free fall is considered to be equivalent to inertial motion, meaning that free-falling inertial objects are accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground.[29][30] In contrast to Newtonian physics, Einstein believed that it was possible for this acceleration to occur without any force being applied to the object.\n Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called geodesics. As in Newton's first law of motion, Einstein believed that a force applied to an object would cause it to deviate from a geodesic. For instance, people standing on the surface of the Earth are prevented from following a geodesic path because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on them. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.\n Einstein's description of gravity was quickly accepted by the majority of physicists, as it was able to explain a wide variety of previously baffling experimental results.[31] In the coming years, a wide range of experiments provided additional support for the idea of general relativity.[32][33][34][35] Today, Einstein's theory of relativity is used for all gravitational calculations where absolute precision is desired, although Newton's inverse-square law continues to be a useful and fairly accurate approximation.[36]\n In modern physics, general relativity remains the framework for the understanding of gravity.[37] Physicists continue to work to find solutions to the Einstein field equations that form the basis of general relativity, while some scientists have speculated that general relativity may not be applicable at all in certain scenarios.[36]\n The Einstein field equations are a system of 10 partial differential equations which describe how matter affects the curvature of spacetime. The system is often expressed in the form\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\n\n+\n\u039b\n\ng\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\n\n=\n\u03ba\n\nT\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G_{\\mu \\nu }+\\Lambda g_{\\mu \\nu }=\\kappa T_{\\mu \\nu },}\n\n\nwhere G\u03bc\u03bd is the Einstein tensor, g\u03bc\u03bd is the metric tensor, T\u03bc\u03bd is the stress\u2013energy tensor, \u039b is the cosmological constant, \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n is the Newtonian constant of gravitation and \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n is the speed of light.[38] The constant \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n=\n\n\n\n8\n\u03c0\nG\n\n\nc\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa ={\\frac {8\\pi G}{c^{4}}}}\n\n is referred to as the Einstein gravitational constant.[39]\n A major area of research is the discovery of exact solutions to the Einstein field equations. Solving these equations amounts to calculating a precise value for the metric tensor (which defines the curvature and geometry of spacetime) under certain physical conditions. There is no formal definition for what constitutes such solutions, but most scientists agree that they should be expressable using elementary functions or linear differential equations.[40] Some of the most notable solutions of the equations include: \n Today, there remain many important situations in which the Einstein field equations have not been solved. Chief among these is the two-body problem, which concerns the geometry of spacetime around two mutually interacting massive objects (such as the Sun and the Earth, or the two stars in a binary star system). The situation gets even more complicated when considering the interactions of three or more massive bodies (the \"n-body problem\"), and some scientists suspect that the Einstein field equations will never be solved in this context.[49] However, it is still possible to construct an approximate solution to the field equations in the n-body problem by using the technique of post-Newtonian expansion.[50] In general, the extreme nonlinearity of the Einstein field equations makes it difficult to solve them in all but the most specific cases.[51]\n Despite its success in predicting the effects of gravity at large scales, general relativity is ultimately incompatible with quantum mechanics. This is because general relativity describes gravity as a smooth, continuous distortion of spacetime, while quantum mechanics holds that all forces arise from the exchange of discrete particles known as quanta. This contradiction is especially vexing to physicists because the other three fundamental forces (strong force, weak force and electromagnetism) were reconciled with a quantum framework decades ago.[52] As a result, modern researchers have begun to search for a theory that could unite both gravity and quantum mechanics under a more general framework.[53]\n One path is to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory, which has been successful to accurately describe the other fundamental interactions. The electromagnetic force arises from an exchange of virtual photons, where the QFT description of gravity is that there is an exchange of virtual gravitons.[54][55] This description reproduces general relativity in the classical limit. However, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck length,[56] where a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum mechanics) is required.\n Testing the predictions of general relativity has historically been difficult, because they are almost identical to the predictions of Newtonian gravity for small energies and masses.[57] Still, since its development, an ongoing series of experimental results have provided support for the theory:[57]\n Every planetary body (including the Earth) is surrounded by its own gravitational field, which can be conceptualized with Newtonian physics as exerting an attractive force on all objects. Assuming a spherically symmetrical planet, the strength of this field at any given point above the surface is proportional to the planetary body's mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the body.\n The strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence.[70] The rate of acceleration of falling objects near the Earth's surface varies very slightly depending on latitude, surface features such as mountains and ridges, and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities.[71] For purposes of weights and measures, a standard gravity value is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, under the International System of Units (SI).\n The force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:[72] (a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference. The force of gravity is weakest at the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation and because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the Earth. The force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780\u00a0m/s2 at the Equator to about 9.832\u00a0m/s2 at the poles.[citation needed] Canada's Hudson Bay has less gravity than any place on Earth.[73]\n The earliest gravity (possibly in the form of quantum gravity, supergravity or a gravitational singularity), along with ordinary space and time, developed during the Planck epoch (up to 10\u221243 seconds after the birth of the Universe), possibly from a primeval state (such as a false vacuum, quantum vacuum or virtual particle), in a currently unknown manner.[4]\n General relativity predicts that energy can be transported out of a system through gravitational radiation. The first indirect evidence for gravitational radiation was through measurements of the Hulse\u2013Taylor binary in 1973. This system consists of a pulsar and neutron star in orbit around one another. Its orbital period has decreased since its initial discovery due to a loss of energy, which is consistent for the amount of energy loss due to gravitational radiation. This research was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993.[citation needed]\n The first direct evidence for gravitational radiation was measured on 14 September 2015 by the LIGO detectors. The gravitational waves emitted during the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light years from Earth were measured.[74][75] This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of Einstein and others that such waves exist. It also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the Universe including the Big Bang.[76] Neutron star and black hole formation also create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation.[77] This research was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017.[78]\n In December 2012, a research team in China announced that it had produced measurements of the phase lag of Earth tides during full and new moons which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light.[79] This means that if the Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would keep orbiting the vacant point normally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to travel that distance. The team's findings were released in Science Bulletin in February 2013.[80]\n In October 2017, the LIGO and Virgo detectors received gravitational wave signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing signals from the same direction. This confirmed that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as the speed of light.[81]\n There are some observations that are not adequately accounted for, which may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in other ways.\n"

        "\n\nPhenomenology is the study of structures of consciousness as\nexperienced from the first-person point of view. The central structure\nof an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward\nsomething, as it is an experience of or about some object. An\nexperience is directed toward an object by virtue of its content or\nmeaning (which represents the object) together with appropriate\nenabling conditions. \n\nPhenomenology as a discipline is distinct from but related to other\nkey disciplines in philosophy, such as ontology, epistemology, logic,\nand ethics. Phenomenology has been practiced in various guises for\ncenturies, but it came into its own in the early 20th century in the\nworks of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty and others.\nPhenomenological issues of intentionality, consciousness, qualia, and\nfirst-person perspective have been prominent in recent philosophy of\nmind. \n\nPhenomenology is commonly understood in either of two ways: as a\ndisciplinary field in philosophy, or as a movement in the history of\nphilosophy. \n\nThe discipline of phenomenology may be defined initially as the\nstudy of structures of experience, or consciousness. Literally,\nphenomenology is the study of \u201cphenomena\u201d: appearances of things, or\nthings as they appear in our experience, or the ways we experience\nthings, thus the meanings things have in our experience. Phenomenology\nstudies conscious experience as experienced from the subjective or\nfirst person point of view. This field of philosophy is then to be\ndistinguished from, and related to, the other main fields of\nphilosophy: ontology (the study of being or what is), epistemology (the\nstudy of knowledge), logic (the study of valid reasoning), ethics (the\nstudy of right and wrong action), etc. \n\nThe historical movement of phenomenology is the philosophical\ntradition launched in the first half of the 20th century by\nEdmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul\nSartre, et al. In that movement, the discipline of\nphenomenology was prized as the proper foundation of all \nphilosophy\u2014as opposed, say, to ethics or metaphysics or epistemology. The\nmethods and characterization of the discipline were widely debated by\nHusserl and his successors, and these debates continue to the present\nday. (The definition of phenomenology offered above will thus be\ndebatable, for example, by Heideggerians, but it remains the starting\npoint in characterizing the discipline.) \n\nIn recent philosophy of mind, the term \u201cphenomenology\u201d is often\nrestricted to the characterization of sensory qualities of seeing,\nhearing, etc.: what it is like to have sensations of various kinds.\nHowever, our experience is normally much richer in content than mere\nsensation. Accordingly, in the phenomenological tradition,\nphenomenology is given a much wider range, addressing the meaning\nthings have in our experience, notably, the significance of objects,\nevents, tools, the flow of time, the self, and others, as these things\narise and are experienced in our \u201clife-world\u201d. \n\nPhenomenology as a discipline has been central to the tradition of\ncontinental European philosophy throughout the 20th century,\nwhile philosophy of mind has evolved in the Austro-Anglo-American\ntradition of analytic philosophy that developed throughout the\n20th century. Yet the fundamental character of our mental\nactivity is pursued in overlapping ways within these two traditions.\nAccordingly, the perspective on phenomenology drawn in this article\nwill accommodate both traditions. The main concern here will be to\ncharacterize the discipline of phenomenology, in a contemporary\npurview, while also highlighting the historical tradition that brought\nthe discipline into its own. \n\nBasically, phenomenology studies the structure of various types of\nexperience ranging from perception, thought, memory, imagination,\nemotion, desire, and volition to bodily awareness, embodied action, and\nsocial activity, including linguistic activity. The structure of these\nforms of experience typically involves what Husserl called\n\u201cintentionality\u201d, that is, the directedness of experience toward things\nin the world, the property of consciousness that it is a consciousness\nof or about something. According to classical Husserlian phenomenology,\nour experience is directed toward\u2014represents or \n\u201cintends\u201d\u2014things only through particular concepts, thoughts,\nideas, images, etc. These make up the meaning or content of a given\nexperience, and are distinct from the things they present or mean. \n\nThe basic intentional structure of consciousness, we find in\nreflection or analysis, involves further forms of experience. Thus,\nphenomenology develops a complex account of temporal awareness (within\nthe stream of consciousness), spatial awareness (notably in\nperception), attention (distinguishing focal and marginal or\n\u201chorizonal\u201d awareness), awareness of one\u2019s own experience\n(self-consciousness, in one sense), self-awareness\n(awareness-of-oneself), the self in different roles (as thinking,\nacting, etc.), embodied action (including kinesthetic awareness of\none\u2019s movement), purpose or intention in action (more or less\nexplicit), awareness of other persons (in empathy, intersubjectivity,\ncollectivity), linguistic activity (involving meaning, communication,\nunderstanding others), social interaction (including collective\naction), and everyday activity in our surrounding life-world (in a\nparticular culture). \n\nFurthermore, in a different dimension, we find various grounds or\nenabling conditions\u2014conditions of the possibility\u2014of\nintentionality, including embodiment, bodily skills, cultural context,\nlanguage and other social practices, social background, and contextual\naspects of intentional activities. Thus, phenomenology leads from\nconscious experience into conditions that help to give experience its\nintentionality. Traditional phenomenology has focused on subjective,\npractical, and social conditions of experience. Recent philosophy of\nmind, however, has focused especially on the neural substrate of\nexperience, on how conscious experience and mental representation or\nintentionality are grounded in brain activity. It remains a difficult\nquestion how much of these grounds of experience fall within the\nprovince of phenomenology as a discipline. Cultural conditions thus\nseem closer to our experience and to our familiar self-understanding\nthan do the electrochemical workings of our brain, much less our\ndependence on quantum-mechanical states of physical systems to which we\nmay belong. The cautious thing to say is that phenomenology leads in\nsome ways into at least some background conditions of our\nexperience. \n\nThe discipline of phenomenology is defined by its domain of study,\nits methods, and its main results. \n\nPhenomenology studies structures of conscious experience as\nexperienced from the first-person point of view, along with relevant\nconditions of experience. The central structure of an experience is its\nintentionality, the way it is directed through its content or meaning\ntoward a certain object in the world. \n\nWe all experience various types of experience including perception,\nimagination, thought, emotion, desire, volition, and action. Thus, the\ndomain of phenomenology is the range of experiences including these\ntypes (among others). Experience includes not only relatively passive\nexperience as in vision or hearing, but also active experience as in\nwalking or hammering a nail or kicking a ball. (The range will be\nspecific to each species of being that enjoys consciousness; our focus\nis on our own, human, experience. Not all conscious beings will, or\nwill be able to, practice phenomenology, as we do.) \n\nConscious experiences have a unique feature: we experience\nthem, we live through them or perform them. Other things in the world\nwe may observe and engage. But we do not experience them, in the sense\nof living through or performing them. This experiential or first-person\nfeature\u2014that of being experienced\u2014is an essential part\nof the nature or structure of conscious experience: as we say, \u201cI see /\nthink / desire / do \u2026\u201d This feature is both a phenomenological\nand an ontological feature of each experience: it is part of what it is\nfor the experience to be experienced (phenomenological) and part of\nwhat it is for the experience to be (ontological). \n\nHow shall we study conscious experience? We reflect on various types\nof experiences just as we experience them. That is to say, we proceed\nfrom the first-person point of view. However, we do not normally\ncharacterize an experience at the time we are performing it. In many\ncases we do not have that capability: a state of intense anger or fear,\nfor example, consumes all of one\u2019s psychic focus at the time. Rather,\nwe acquire a background of having lived through a given type of\nexperience, and we look to our familiarity with that type of\nexperience: hearing a song, seeing a sunset, thinking about love,\nintending to jump a hurdle. The practice of phenomenology assumes such\nfamiliarity with the type of experiences to be characterized.\nImportantly, also, it is types of experience that phenomenology\npursues, rather than a particular fleeting experience\u2014unless\nits type is what interests us. \n\nClassical phenomenologists practiced some three distinguishable\nmethods. (1) We describe a type of experience just as we find it in our\nown (past) experience. Thus, Husserl and Merleau-Ponty spoke of pure\ndescription of lived experience. (2) We interpret a type of experience\nby relating it to relevant features of context. In this vein, Heidegger\nand his followers spoke of hermeneutics, the art of interpretation in\ncontext, especially social and linguistic context. (3) We analyze the\nform of a type of experience. In the end, all the classical\nphenomenologists practiced analysis of experience, factoring out\nnotable features for further elaboration. \n\nThese traditional methods have been ramified in recent decades,\nexpanding the methods available to phenomenology. Thus: (4) In a\nlogico-semantic model of phenomenology, we specify the truth conditions\nfor a type of thinking (say, where I think that dogs chase cats) or the\nsatisfaction conditions for a type of intention (say, where I intend or\nwill to jump that hurdle). (5) In the experimental paradigm of\ncognitive neuroscience, we design empirical experiments that tend to\nconfirm or refute aspects of experience (say, where a brain scan shows\nelectrochemical activity in a specific region of the brain thought to\nsubserve a type of vision or emotion or motor control). This style of\n\u201cneurophenomenology\u201d assumes that conscious experience is grounded in\nneural activity in embodied action in appropriate \nsurroundings\u2014mixing pure phenomenology with biological and physical science in a way\nthat was not wholly congenial to traditional phenomenologists. \n\nWhat makes an experience conscious is a certain awareness one has of\nthe experience while living through or performing it. This form of\ninner awareness has been a topic of considerable debate, centuries\nafter the issue arose with Locke\u2019s notion of self-consciousness on the\nheels of Descartes\u2019 sense of consciousness (conscience,\nco-knowledge). Does this awareness-of-experience consist in a kind of\ninner observation of the experience, as if one were doing two things at\nonce? (Brentano argued no.) Is it a higher-order perception of one\u2019s\nmind\u2019s operation, or is it a higher-order thought about one\u2019s mental\nactivity? (Recent theorists have proposed both.) Or is it a different\nform of inherent structure? (Sartre took this line, drawing on Brentano\nand Husserl.) These issues are beyond the scope of this article, but\nnotice that these results of phenomenological analysis shape the\ncharacterization of the domain of study and the methodology appropriate\nto the domain. For awareness-of-experience is a defining trait of\nconscious experience, the trait that gives experience a first-person,\nlived character. It is that lived character of experience that allows a\nfirst-person perspective on the object of study, namely, experience,\nand that perspective is characteristic of the methodology of\nphenomenology. \n\nConscious experience is the starting point of phenomenology, but\nexperience shades off into less overtly conscious phenomena. As Husserl\nand others stressed, we are only vaguely aware of things in the margin\nor periphery of attention, and we are only implicitly aware of the\nwider horizon of things in the world around us. Moreover, as Heidegger\nstressed, in practical activities like walking along, or hammering a\nnail, or speaking our native tongue, we are not explicitly conscious of\nour habitual patterns of action. Furthermore, as psychoanalysts have\nstressed, much of our intentional mental activity is not conscious at\nall, but may become conscious in the process of therapy or\ninterrogation, as we come to realize how we feel or think about\nsomething. We should allow, then, that the domain of \nphenomenology\u2014our own experience\u2014spreads out from conscious\nexperience into semi-conscious and even unconscious mental activity,\nalong with relevant background conditions implicitly invoked in our\nexperience. (These issues are subject to debate; the point here is to\nopen the door to the question of where to draw the boundary of the\ndomain of phenomenology.) \n\nTo begin an elementary exercise in phenomenology, consider some\ntypical experiences one might have in everyday life, characterized in\nthe first person: \n\nHere are rudimentary characterizations of some familiar types of\nexperience. Each sentence is a simple form of phenomenological\ndescription, articulating in everyday English the structure of the type\nof experience so described. The subject term \u201cI\u201d indicates the\nfirst-person structure of the experience: the intentionality proceeds\nfrom the subject. The verb indicates the type of intentional activity\ndescribed: perception, thought, imagination, etc. Of central importance\nis the way that objects of awareness are presented or intended in our\nexperiences, especially, the way we see or conceive or think about\nobjects. The direct-object expression (\u201cthat fishing boat off the\ncoast\u201d) articulates the mode of presentation of the object in the\nexperience: the content or meaning of the experience, the core of what\nHusserl called noema. In effect, the object-phrase expresses the noema\nof the act described, that is, to the extent that language has\nappropriate expressive power. The overall form of the given sentence\narticulates the basic form of intentionality in the experience:\nsubject-act-content-object. \n\nRich phenomenological description or interpretation, as in Husserl,\nMerleau-Ponty et al., will far outrun such simple\nphenomenological descriptions as above. But such simple descriptions\nbring out the basic form of intentionality. As we interpret the\nphenomenological description further, we may assess the relevance of\nthe context of experience. And we may turn to wider conditions of the\npossibility of that type of experience. In this way, in the practice of\nphenomenology, we classify, describe, interpret, and analyze structures\nof experiences in ways that answer to our own experience. \n\nIn such interpretive-descriptive analyses of experience, we\nimmediately observe that we are analyzing familiar forms of\nconsciousness, conscious experience of or about this or that.\nIntentionality is thus the salient structure of our experience, and\nmuch of phenomenology proceeds as the study of different aspects of\nintentionality. Thus, we explore structures of the stream of\nconsciousness, the enduring self, the embodied self, and bodily action.\nFurthermore, as we reflect on how these phenomena work, we turn to the\nanalysis of relevant conditions that enable our experiences to occur as\nthey do, and to represent or intend as they do. Phenomenology then\nleads into analyses of conditions of the possibility of intentionality,\nconditions involving motor skills and habits, background social\npractices, and often language, with its special place in human\naffairs. \nThe Oxford English Dictionary presents the following\ndefinition: \u201cPhenomenology. a. The science of phenomena as distinct\nfrom being (ontology). b. That division of any science which describes\nand classifies its phenomena. From the Greek phainomenon,\nappearance.\u201d In philosophy, the term is used in the first sense, amid\ndebates of theory and methodology. In physics and philosophy of\nscience, the term is used in the second sense, albeit only\noccasionally. \n\nIn its root meaning, then, phenomenology is the study of\nphenomena: literally, appearances as opposed to reality. This\nancient distinction launched philosophy as we emerged from Plato\u2019s\ncave. Yet the discipline of phenomenology did not blossom until the\n20th century and remains poorly understood in many circles of\ncontemporary philosophy. What is that discipline? How did philosophy\nmove from a root concept of phenomena to the discipline of\nphenomenology? \n\nOriginally, in the 18th century, \u201cphenomenology\u201d meant the\ntheory of appearances fundamental to empirical knowledge, especially\nsensory appearances.  The Latin term \u201cPhenomenologia\u201d was\nintroduced by Christoph Friedrich Oetinger in 1736.  Subsequently, the\nGerman term \u201cPh\u00e4nomenologia\u201d was used by Johann\nHeinrich Lambert, a follower of Christian Wolff. Immanuel Kant used\nthe term occasionally in various writings, as did Johann Gottlieb\nFichte.  In 1807, G. W. F. Hegel wrote a book\ntitled Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes (usually translated\nas Phenomenology of Spirit). By 1889 Franz Brentano used the\nterm to characterize what he called \u201cdescriptive\npsychology\u201d. From there Edmund Husserl took up the term for his\nnew science of consciousness, and the rest is history. \n\nSuppose we say phenomenology studies phenomena: what appears to \nus\u2014and its appearing. How shall we understand phenomena? The term\nhas a rich history in recent centuries, in which we can see traces of\nthe emerging discipline of phenomenology. \n\nIn a strict empiricist vein, what appears before the mind are\nsensory data or qualia: either patterns of one\u2019s own sensations (seeing\nred here now, feeling this ticklish feeling, hearing that resonant bass\ntone) or sensible patterns of worldly things, say, the looks and smells\nof flowers (what John Locke called secondary qualities of things). In a\nstrict rationalist vein, by contrast, what appears before the mind are\nideas, rationally formed \u201cclear and distinct ideas\u201d (in Ren\u00e9\nDescartes\u2019 ideal). In Immanuel Kant\u2019s theory of knowledge, fusing\nrationalist and empiricist aims, what appears to the mind are phenomena\ndefined as things-as-they-appear or things-as-they-are-represented (in\na synthesis of sensory and conceptual forms of objects-as-known). In\nAuguste Comte\u2019s theory of science, phenomena (phenomenes) are\nthe facts (faits, what occurs) that a given science would\nexplain. \n\nIn 18th and 19th century epistemology, then,\nphenomena are the starting points in building knowledge, especially\nscience. Accordingly, in a familiar and still current sense, phenomena\nare whatever we observe (perceive) and seek to explain. \n\nAs the discipline of psychology emerged late in the 19th\ncentury, however, phenomena took on a somewhat different guise. In\nFranz Brentano\u2019s Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint\n(1874), phenomena are what occur in the mind: mental phenomena are acts\nof consciousness (or their contents), and physical phenomena are\nobjects of external perception starting with colors and shapes. For\nBrentano, physical phenomena exist \u201cintentionally\u201d in acts of\nconsciousness. This view revives a Medieval notion Brentano called\n\u201cintentional in-existence\u201d, but the ontology remains undeveloped (what\nis it to exist in the mind, and do physical objects exist only in the\nmind?). More generally, we might say, phenomena are whatever we are\nconscious of: objects and events around us, other people, ourselves,\neven (in reflection) our own conscious experiences, as we experience\nthese. In a certain technical sense, phenomena are things as\nthey are given to our consciousness, whether in perception or\nimagination or thought or volition. This conception of phenomena would\nsoon inform the new discipline of phenomenology. \n\nBrentano distinguished descriptive psychology from\ngenetic psychology. Where genetic psychology seeks the causes\nof various types of mental phenomena, descriptive psychology defines\nand classifies the various types of mental phenomena, including\nperception, judgment, emotion, etc. According to Brentano, every mental\nphenomenon, or act of consciousness, is directed toward some object,\nand only mental phenomena are so directed. This thesis of intentional\ndirectedness was the hallmark of Brentano\u2019s descriptive psychology. In\n1889 Brentano used the term \u201cphenomenology\u201d for descriptive psychology,\nand the way was paved for Husserl\u2019s new science of phenomenology. \n\nPhenomenology as we know it was launched by Edmund Husserl in his\nLogical Investigations (1900\u201301). Two importantly different\nlines of theory came together in that monumental work: psychological\ntheory, on the heels of Franz Brentano (and also William James, whose\nPrinciples of Psychology appeared in 1891 and greatly\nimpressed Husserl); and logical or semantic theory, on the heels of\nBernard Bolzano and Husserl\u2019s contemporaries who founded modern logic,\nincluding Gottlob Frege. (Interestingly, both lines of research trace\nback to Aristotle, and both reached importantly new results in\nHusserl\u2019s day.) \n\nHusserl\u2019s Logical Investigations was inspired by Bolzano\u2019s\nideal of logic, while taking up Brentano\u2019s conception of descriptive\npsychology. In his Theory of Science (1835) Bolzano\ndistinguished between subjective and objective ideas or representations\n(Vorstellungen). In effect Bolzano criticized Kant and before\nhim the classical empiricists and rationalists for failing to make this\nsort of distinction, thereby rendering phenomena merely subjective.\nLogic studies objective ideas, including propositions, which in turn\nmake up objective theories as in the sciences. Psychology would, by\ncontrast, study subjective ideas, the concrete contents (occurrences)\nof mental activities in particular minds at a given time. Husserl was\nafter both, within a single discipline. So phenomena must be\nreconceived as objective intentional contents (sometimes called\nintentional objects) of subjective acts of consciousness. Phenomenology\nwould then study this complex of consciousness and correlated\nphenomena. In Ideas I (Book One, 1913) Husserl introduced two\nGreek words to capture his version of the Bolzanoan distinction:\nnoesis and noema, from the Greek verb\nno\u00e9\u014d (\u03bd\u03bf\u03ad\u03c9), meaning to\nperceive, think, intend, whence the noun nous or mind. The\nintentional process of consciousness is called noesis, while\nits ideal content is called\nnoema. The noema of an act of consciousness Husserl\ncharacterized both as an ideal meaning and as \u201cthe object as\nintended\u201d. Thus the phenomenon, or object-as-it-appears, becomes the\nnoema, or object-as-it-is-intended. The interpretations of Husserl\u2019s\ntheory of noema have been several and amount to different developments\nof Husserl\u2019s basic theory of intentionality. (Is the noema an aspect of\nthe object intended, or rather a medium of intention?) \n\nFor Husserl, then, phenomenology integrates a kind of psychology\nwith a kind of logic. It develops a descriptive or analytic psychology\nin that it describes and analyzes types of subjective mental activity\nor experience, in short, acts of consciousness. Yet it develops a kind\nof logic\u2014a theory of meaning (today we say logical \nsemantics)\u2014in that it describes and analyzes objective contents of\nconsciousness: ideas, concepts, images, propositions, in short, ideal\nmeanings of various types that serve as intentional contents, or\nnoematic meanings, of various types of experience. These contents are\nshareable by different acts of consciousness, and in that sense they\nare objective, ideal meanings. Following Bolzano (and to some extent\nthe platonistic logician Hermann Lotze), Husserl opposed any reduction\nof logic or mathematics or science to mere psychology, to how people\nhappen to think, and in the same spirit he distinguished phenomenology\nfrom mere psychology. For Husserl, phenomenology would study\nconsciousness without reducing the objective and shareable meanings\nthat inhabit experience to merely subjective happenstances. Ideal\nmeaning would be the engine of intentionality in acts of\nconsciousness. \n\nA clear conception of phenomenology awaited Husserl\u2019s development of\na clear model of intentionality. Indeed, phenomenology and the modern\nconcept of intentionality emerged hand-in-hand in Husserl\u2019s Logical\nInvestigations (1900\u201301). With theoretical foundations laid in the\nInvestigations, Husserl would then promote the radical new\nscience of phenomenology in Ideas I (1913). And alternative\nvisions of phenomenology would soon follow. \n\nPhenomenology came into its own with Husserl, much as epistemology\ncame into its own with Descartes, and ontology or metaphysics came into\nits own with Aristotle on the heels of Plato. Yet phenomenology has\nbeen practiced, with or without the name, for many centuries. When\nHindu and Buddhist philosophers reflected on states of consciousness\nachieved in a variety of meditative states, they were practicing\nphenomenology. When Descartes, Hume, and Kant characterized states of\nperception, thought, and imagination, they were practicing\nphenomenology. When Brentano classified varieties of mental phenomena\n(defined by the directedness of consciousness), he was practicing\nphenomenology. When William James appraised kinds of mental activity in\nthe stream of consciousness (including their embodiment and their\ndependence on habit), he too was practicing phenomenology. And when\nrecent analytic philosophers of mind have addressed issues of\nconsciousness and intentionality, they have often been practicing\nphenomenology. Still, the discipline of phenomenology, its roots\ntracing back through the centuries, came to full flower in Husserl. \n\nHusserl\u2019s work was followed by a flurry of phenomenological writing\nin the first half of the 20th century. The diversity of\ntraditional phenomenology is apparent in the Encyclopedia of\nPhenomenology (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997, Dordrecht and\nBoston), which features separate articles on some seven types of\nphenomenology. (1) Transcendental constitutive phenomenology studies\nhow objects are constituted in pure or transcendental consciousness,\nsetting aside questions of any relation to the natural world around us.\n(2) Naturalistic constitutive phenomenology studies how consciousness\nconstitutes or takes things in the world of nature, assuming with the\nnatural attitude that consciousness is part of nature. (3) Existential\nphenomenology studies concrete human existence, including our\nexperience of free choice or action in concrete situations. (4)\nGenerative historicist phenomenology studies how meaning, as found in\nour experience, is generated in historical processes of collective\nexperience over time. (5) Genetic phenomenology studies the genesis of\nmeanings of things within one\u2019s own stream of experience. (6)\nHermeneutical phenomenology studies interpretive structures of\nexperience, how we understand and engage things around us in our human\nworld, including ourselves and others. (7) Realistic phenomenology\nstudies the structure of consciousness and intentionality, assuming it\noccurs in a real world that is largely external to consciousness and\nnot somehow brought into being by consciousness. \n\nThe most famous of the classical phenomenologists were Husserl,\nHeidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. In these four thinkers we find\ndifferent conceptions of phenomenology, different methods, and\ndifferent results. A brief sketch of their differences will capture\nboth a crucial period in the history of phenomenology and a sense of\nthe diversity of the field of phenomenology. \n\nIn his Logical Investigations (1900\u201301) Husserl outlined a\ncomplex system of philosophy, moving from logic to philosophy of\nlanguage, to ontology (theory of universals and parts of wholes), to a\nphenomenological theory of intentionality, and finally to a\nphenomenological theory of knowledge. Then in Ideas I (1913)\nhe focused squarely on phenomenology itself. Husserl defined\nphenomenology as \u201cthe science of the essence of consciousness\u201d,\ncentered on the defining trait of intentionality, approached explicitly\n\u201cin the first person\u201d. (See Husserl, Ideas I,\n\u00a4\u00a433ff.) In this spirit, we may say phenomenology is the\nstudy of consciousness\u2014that is, conscious experience of various\ntypes\u2014as experienced from the first-person point of view. In\nthis discipline we study different forms of experience just as\nwe experience them, from the perspective of the subject living through\nor performing them. Thus, we characterize experiences of seeing,\nhearing, imagining, thinking, feeling (i.e., emotion), wishing,\ndesiring, willing, and also acting, that is, embodied volitional\nactivities of walking, talking, cooking, carpentering, etc. However,\nnot just any characterization of an experience will do.\nPhenomenological analysis of a given type of experience will feature\nthe ways in which we ourselves would experience that form of conscious\nactivity. And the leading property of our familiar types of experience\nis their intentionality, their being a consciousness of or about\nsomething, something experienced or presented or engaged in a certain\nway. How I see or conceptualize or understand the object I am dealing\nwith defines the meaning of that object in my current experience. Thus,\nphenomenology features a study of meaning, in a wide sense that\nincludes more than what is expressed in language. \n\nIn Ideas I Husserl presented phenomenology with a\ntranscendental turn. In part this means that Husserl took on the\nKantian idiom of \u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d, looking for\nconditions of the possibility of knowledge, or of consciousness\ngenerally, and arguably turning away from any reality beyond\nphenomena. But Husserl\u2019s transcendental turn also involved his\ndiscovery of the method of\nepoch\u00e9 (from the Greek skeptics\u2019 notion of abstaining\nfrom belief). We are to practice phenomenology, Husserl proposed, by\n\u201cbracketing\u201d the question of the existence of the natural\nworld around us. We thereby turn our attention, in reflection, to the\nstructure of our own conscious experience. Our first key result is the\nobservation that each act of consciousness is a consciousness of\nsomething, that is, intentional, or directed toward\nsomething. Consider my visual experience wherein I see a tree across\nthe square. In phenomenological reflection, we need not concern\nourselves with whether the tree exists: my experience is of a tree\nwhether or not such a tree exists. However, we do need to concern\nourselves with how the object is meant or intended. I see a\nEucalyptus tree, not a Yucca tree; I see that object as a Eucalyptus,\nwith a certain shape, with bark stripping off, etc. Thus, bracketing\nthe tree itself, we turn our attention to my experience of the tree,\nand specifically to the content or meaning in my experience. This\ntree-as-perceived Husserl calls the noema or noematic sense of the\nexperience. \n\nPhilosophers succeeding Husserl debated the proper characterization\nof phenomenology, arguing over its results and its methods. Adolf\nReinach, an early student of Husserl\u2019s (who died in World War I),\nargued that phenomenology should remain allied with a realist ontology,\nas in Husserl\u2019s Logical Investigations. Roman Ingarden, a\nPolish phenomenologist of the next generation, continued the resistance\nto Husserl\u2019s turn to transcendental idealism. For such philosophers,\nphenomenology should not bracket questions of being or ontology, as the\nmethod of epoch\u00e9 would suggest. And they were not\nalone. Martin Heidegger studied Husserl\u2019s early writings, worked as\nAssistant to Husserl in 1916, and in 1928 succeeded Husserl in the\nprestigious chair at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger had his own\nideas about phenomenology. \n\nIn Being and Time (1927) Heidegger unfurled his rendition\nof phenomenology. For Heidegger, we and our activities are always \u201cin\nthe world\u201d, our being is being-in-the-world, so we do not study our\nactivities by bracketing the world, rather we interpret our activities\nand the meaning things have for us by looking to our contextual\nrelations to things in the world. Indeed, for Heidegger, phenomenology\nresolves into what he called \u201cfundamental ontology\u201d. We must\ndistinguish beings from their being, and we begin our investigation of\nthe meaning of being in our own case, examining our own existence in\nthe activity of \u201cDasein\u201d (that being whose being is in each case my\nown). Heidegger resisted Husserl\u2019s neo-Cartesian emphasis on\nconsciousness and subjectivity, including how perception presents\nthings around us. By contrast, Heidegger held that our more basic ways\nof relating to things are in practical activities like hammering, where\nthe phenomenology reveals our situation in a context of equipment and\nin being-with-others. \n\nIn Being and Time Heidegger approached phenomenology, in a\nquasi-poetic idiom, through the root meanings of \u201clogos\u201d\nand \u201cphenomena\u201d, so that phenomenology is defined as the\nart or practice of \u201cletting things show themselves\u201d. In\nHeidegger\u2019s inimitable linguistic play on the Greek roots, \u201c\n\u2018phenomenology\u2019 means \u2026\u2014to let that which\nshows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows\nitself from itself.\u201d (See Heidegger, Being and Time,\n1927, \u00a6 7C.) Here Heidegger explicitly parodies Husserl\u2019s call,\n\u201cTo the things themselves!\u201d, or \u201cTo the phenomena\nthemselves!\u201d Heidegger went on to emphasize practical forms of\ncomportment or better relating (Verhalten) as in hammering a\nnail, as opposed to representational forms of intentionality as in\nseeing or thinking about a hammer. Much of Being and Time\ndevelops an existential interpretation of our modes of being\nincluding, famously, our being-toward-death. \n\nIn a very different style, in clear analytical prose, in the text of a\nlecture course called The Basic Problems of Phenomenology\n(1927), Heidegger traced the question of the meaning of being from\nAristotle through many other thinkers into the issues of\nphenomenology.  Our understanding of beings and their being comes\nultimately through phenomenology. Here the connection with classical\nissues of ontology is more apparent, and consonant with Husserl\u2019s\nvision in the Logical Investigations (an early source of\ninspiration for Heidegger). One of Heidegger\u2019s most innovative ideas\nwas his conception of the \u201cground\u201d of being, looking to\nmodes of being more fundamental than the things around us (from trees\nto hammers). Heidegger questioned the contemporary concern with\ntechnology, and his writing might suggest that our scientific theories\nare historical artifacts that we use in technological practice, rather\nthan systems of ideal truth (as Husserl had held). Our deep\nunderstanding of being, in our own case, comes rather from\nphenomenology, Heidegger held. \n\nIn the 1930s phenomenology migrated from Austrian and then German\nphilosophy into French philosophy. The way had been paved in Marcel\nProust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time, in which the narrator\nrecounts in close detail his vivid recollections of past experiences,\nincluding his famous associations with the smell of freshly baked\nmadeleines. This sensibility to experience traces to Descartes\u2019 work,\nand French phenomenology has been an effort to preserve the central\nthrust of Descartes\u2019 insights while rejecting mind-body dualism. The\nexperience of one\u2019s own body, or one\u2019s lived or living body, has been\nan important motif in many French philosophers of the 20th\ncentury. \n\nIn the novel Nausea (1936) Jean-Paul Sartre described a\nbizarre course of experience in which the protagonist, writing in the\nfirst person, describes how ordinary objects lose their meaning until\nhe encounters pure being at the foot of a chestnut tree, and in that\nmoment recovers his sense of his own freedom. In Being and\nNothingness (1943, written partly while a prisoner of war),\nSartre developed his conception of phenomenological\nontology. Consciousness is a consciousness of objects, as Husserl had\nstressed. In Sartre\u2019s model of intentionality, the central player in\nconsciousness is a phenomenon, and the occurrence of a phenomenon just\nis a consciousness-of-an-object. The chestnut tree I see is, for\nSartre, such a phenomenon in my consciousness. Indeed, all things in\nthe world, as we normally experience them, are phenomena, beneath or\nbehind which lies their \u201cbeing-in-itself\u201d. Consciousness,\nby contrast, has \u201cbeing-for-itself\u201d, since each\nconsciousness is not only a consciousness-of-its-object but also a\npre-reflective consciousness-of-itself (conscience de\nsoi). Yet for Sartre, unlike Husserl, the \u201cI\u201d or self\nis nothing but a sequence of acts of consciousness, notably including\nradically free choices (like a Humean bundle of perceptions). \n\nFor Sartre, the practice of phenomenology proceeds by a deliberate\nreflection on the structure of consciousness. Sartre\u2019s method is in\neffect a literary style of interpretive description of different types\nof experience in relevant situations\u2014a practice that does not\nreally fit the methodological proposals of either Husserl or Heidegger,\nbut makes use of Sartre\u2019s great literary skill. (Sartre wrote many\nplays and novels and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.) \n\nSartre\u2019s phenomenology in Being and Nothingness became the\nphilosophical foundation for his popular philosophy of existentialism,\nsketched in his famous lecture \u201cExistentialism is a\nHumanism\u201d (1945).  In Being and Nothingness Sartre\nemphasized the experience of freedom of choice, especially the project\nof choosing one\u2019s self, the defining pattern of one\u2019s past\nactions. Through vivid description of the \u201clook\u201d of the\nOther, Sartre laid groundwork for the contemporary political\nsignificance of the concept of the Other (as in other groups or\nethnicities). Indeed, in The Second Sex (1949) Simone de\nBeauvoir, Sartre\u2019s life-long companion, launched contemporary feminism\nwith her nuanced account of the perceived role of women as Other. \n\nIn 1940s Paris, Maurice Merleau-Ponty joined with Sartre and\nBeauvoir in developing phenomenology. In Phenomenology of\nPerception (1945) Merleau-Ponty developed a rich variety of\nphenomenology emphasizing the role of the body in human experience.\nUnlike Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre, Merleau-Ponty looked to\nexperimental psychology, analyzing the reported experience of amputees\nwho felt sensations in a phantom limb. Merleau-Ponty rejected both\nassociationist psychology, focused on correlations between sensation\nand stimulus, and intellectualist psychology, focused on rational\nconstruction of the world in the mind. (Think of the behaviorist and\ncomputationalist models of mind in more recent decades of empirical\npsychology.) Instead, Merleau-Ponty focused on the \u201cbody image\u201d, our\nexperience of our own body and its significance in our activities.\nExtending Husserl\u2019s account of the lived body (as opposed to the\nphysical body), Merleau-Ponty resisted the traditional Cartesian\nseparation of mind and body. For the body image is neither in the\nmental realm nor in the mechanical-physical realm. Rather, my body is,\nas it were, me in my engaged action with things I perceive including\nother people. \n\nThe scope of Phenomenology of Perception is characteristic\nof the breadth of classical phenomenology, not least because\nMerleau-Ponty drew (with generosity) on Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre\nwhile fashioning his own innovative vision of phenomenology. His\nphenomenology addressed the role of attention in the phenomenal field,\nthe experience of the body, the spatiality of the body, the motility of\nthe body, the body in sexual being and in speech, other selves,\ntemporality, and the character of freedom so important in French\nexistentialism. Near the end of a chapter on the cogito (Descartes\u2019 \u201cI\nthink, therefore I am\u201d), Merleau-Ponty succinctly captures his\nembodied, existential form of phenomenology, writing: \n\nIn short, consciousness is embodied (in the world), and equally body\nis infused with consciousness (with cognition of the world). \n\nIn the years since Husserl, Heidegger, et al. wrote,\nphenomenologists have dug into all these classical issues, including\nintentionality, temporal awareness, intersubjectivity, practical\nintentionality, and the social and linguistic contexts of human\nactivity. Interpretation of historical texts by Husserl et al.\nhas played a prominent role in this work, both because the texts are\nrich and difficult and because the historical dimension is itself part\nof the practice of continental European philosophy. Since the 1960s,\nphilosophers trained in the methods of analytic philosophy have also\ndug into the foundations of phenomenology, with an eye to\n20th century work in philosophy of logic, language, and\nmind. \n\nPhenomenology was already linked with logical and semantic theory in\nHusserl\u2019s Logical Investigations. Analytic phenomenology\npicks up on that connection. In particular, Dagfinn F\u00f8llesdal\nand J.  N. Mohanty have explored historical and conceptual relations\nbetween Husserl\u2019s phenomenology and Frege\u2019s logical semantics (in\nFrege\u2019s \u201cOn Sense and Reference\u201d, 1892). For Frege, an\nexpression refers to an object by way of a sense: thus, two\nexpressions (say, \u201cthe morning star\u201d and \u201cthe\nevening star\u201d) may refer to the same object (Venus) but express\ndifferent senses with different manners of presentation. For Husserl,\nsimilarly, an experience (or act of consciousness) intends or refers\nto an object by way of a noema or noematic sense: thus, two\nexperiences may refer to the same object but have different noematic\nsenses involving different ways of presenting the object (for example,\nin seeing the same object from different sides). Indeed, for Husserl,\nthe theory of intentionality is a generalization of the theory of\nlinguistic reference: as linguistic reference is mediated by sense, so\nintentional reference is mediated by noematic sense. \n\nMore recently, analytic philosophers of mind have rediscovered\nphenomenological issues of mental representation, intentionality,\nconsciousness, sensory experience, intentional content, and\ncontext-of-thought. Some of these analytic philosophers of mind hark\nback to William James and Franz Brentano at the origins of modern\npsychology, and some look to empirical research in today\u2019s cognitive\nneuroscience. Some researchers have begun to combine phenomenological\nissues with issues of neuroscience and behavioral studies and\nmathematical modeling. Such studies will extend the methods of\ntraditional phenomenology as the Zeitgeist moves on. We\naddress philosophy of mind below. \n\nThe discipline of phenomenology forms one basic field in philosophy\namong others. How is phenomenology distinguished from, and related to,\nother fields in philosophy? \n\nTraditionally, philosophy includes at least four core fields or\ndisciplines: ontology, epistemology, ethics, logic. Suppose\nphenomenology joins that list. Consider then these elementary\ndefinitions of field: \n\nThe domains of study in these five fields are clearly different, and\nthey seem to call for different methods of study. \n\nPhilosophers have sometimes argued that one of these fields is\n\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d, the most fundamental discipline, on which all\nphilosophy or all knowledge or wisdom rests. Historically (it may be\nargued), Socrates and Plato put ethics first, then Aristotle put\nmetaphysics or ontology first, then Descartes put epistemology first,\nthen Russell put logic first, and then Husserl (in his later\ntranscendental phase) put phenomenology first. \n\nConsider epistemology. As we saw, phenomenology helps to define the\nphenomena on which knowledge claims rest, according to modern\nepistemology. On the other hand, phenomenology itself claims to achieve\nknowledge about the nature of consciousness, a distinctive kind of\nfirst-person knowledge, through a form of intuition. \n\nConsider logic. As we saw, logical theory of meaning led Husserl\ninto the theory of intentionality, the heart of phenomenology. On one\naccount, phenomenology explicates the intentional or semantic force of\nideal meanings, and propositional meanings are central to logical\ntheory. But logical structure is expressed in language, either ordinary\nlanguage or symbolic languages like those of predicate logic or\nmathematics or computer systems. It remains an important issue of\ndebate where and whether language shapes specific forms of experience\n(thought, perception, emotion) and their content or meaning. So there\nis an important (if disputed) relation between phenomenology and\nlogico-linguistic theory, especially philosophical logic and philosophy\nof language (as opposed to mathematical logic per se). \n\nConsider ontology. Phenomenology studies (among other things) the\nnature of consciousness, which is a central issue in metaphysics or\nontology, and one that leads into the traditional mind-body problem.\nHusserlian methodology would bracket the question of the existence of\nthe surrounding world, thereby separating phenomenology from the\nontology of the world. Yet Husserl\u2019s phenomenology presupposes theory\nabout species and individuals (universals and particulars), relations\nof part and whole, and ideal meanings\u2014all parts of\nontology. \n\nNow consider ethics. Phenomenology might play a role in ethics by\noffering analyses of the structure of will, valuing, happiness, and\ncare for others (in empathy and sympathy). Historically, though,\nethics has been on the horizon of phenomenology. Husserl largely\navoided ethics in his major works, though he featured the role of\npractical concerns in the structure of the life-world or\nof Geist (spirit, or culture, as in Zeitgeist), and\nhe once delivered a course of lectures giving ethics (like logic) a\nbasic place in philosophy, indicating the importance of the\nphenomenology of sympathy in grounding ethics. In Being and\nTime Heidegger claimed not to pursue ethics while discussing\nphenomena ranging from care, conscience, and guilt to\n\u201cfallenness\u201d and \u201cauthenticity\u201d (all phenomena\nwith theological echoes). In Being and Nothingness Sartre\nanalyzed with subtlety the logical problem of \u201cbad faith\u201d,\nyet he developed an ontology of value as produced by willing in good\nfaith (which sounds like a revised Kantian foundation for\nmorality). Beauvoir sketched an existentialist ethics, and Sartre left\nunpublished notebooks on ethics. However, an explicitly\nphenomenological approach to ethics emerged in the works of Emannuel\nLevinas, a Lithuanian phenomenologist who heard Husserl and Heidegger\nin Freiburg before moving to Paris. In Totality and Infinity\n(1961), modifying themes drawn from Husserl and Heidegger, Levinas\nfocused on the significance of the \u201cface\u201d of the other,\nexplicitly developing grounds for ethics in this range of\nphenomenology, writing an impressionistic style of prose with\nallusions to religious experience. \n\nAllied with ethics are political and social philosophy. Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty were politically engaged in 1940s Paris, and their\nexistential philosophies (phenomenologically based) suggest a\npolitical theory based in individual freedom. Sartre later sought an\nexplicit blend of existentialism with Marxism. Still, political theory\nhas remained on the borders of phenomenology. Social theory, however,\nhas been closer to phenomenology as such. Husserl analyzed the\nphenomenological structure of the life-world and Geist\ngenerally, including our role in social activity. Heidegger stressed\nsocial practice, which he found more primordial than individual\nconsciousness. Alfred Schutz developed a phenomenology of the social\nworld. Sartre continued the phenomenological appraisal of the meaning\nof the other, the fundamental social formation. Moving outward from\nphenomenological issues, Michel Foucault studied the genesis and\nmeaning of social institutions, from prisons to insane asylums. And\nJacques Derrida has long practiced a kind of phenomenology of\nlanguage, seeking social meaning in the \u201cdeconstruction\u201d\nof wide-ranging texts.  Aspects of French\n\u201cpoststructuralist\u201d theory are sometimes interpreted as\nbroadly phenomenological, but such issues are beyond the present\npurview. \n\nClassical phenomenology, then, ties into certain areas of\nepistemology, logic, and ontology, and leads into parts of ethical,\nsocial, and political theory. \n\nIt ought to be obvious that phenomenology has a lot to say in the\narea called philosophy of mind. Yet the traditions of phenomenology and\nanalytic philosophy of mind have not been closely joined, despite\noverlapping areas of interest. So it is appropriate to close this\nsurvey of phenomenology by addressing philosophy of mind, one of the\nmost vigorously debated areas in recent philosophy. \n\nThe tradition of analytic philosophy began, early in the 20th\ncentury, with analyses of language, notably in the works of Gottlob\nFrege, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Then in The Concept\nof Mind (1949) Gilbert Ryle developed a series of analyses of language\nabout different mental states, including sensation, belief, and will.\nThough Ryle is commonly deemed a philosopher of ordinary language, Ryle\nhimself said The Concept of Mind could be called phenomenology. In\neffect, Ryle analyzed our phenomenological understanding of mental\nstates as reflected in ordinary language about the mind. From this\nlinguistic phenomenology Ryle argued that Cartesian mind-body dualism\ninvolves a category mistake (the logic or grammar of mental \nverbs\u2014\u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201csee\u201d, etc.\u2014does not\nmean that we ascribe belief, sensation, etc., to \u201cthe ghost in\nthe machine\u201d). With Ryle\u2019s rejection of mind-body dualism, the\nmind-body problem was re-awakened: what is the ontology of mind\nvis-\u00e0-vis body, and how are mind and body related? \n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes, in his epoch-making Meditations on First\nPhilosophy (1641), had argued that minds and bodies are two distinct\nkinds of being or substance with two distinct kinds of attributes or\nmodes: bodies are characterized by spatiotemporal physical properties,\nwhile minds are characterized by properties of thinking (including\nseeing, feeling, etc.). Centuries later, phenomenology would find, with\nBrentano and Husserl, that mental acts are characterized by\nconsciousness and intentionality, while natural science would find that\nphysical systems are characterized by mass and force, ultimately by\ngravitational, electromagnetic, and quantum fields. Where do we find\nconsciousness and intentionality in the\nquantum-electromagnetic-gravitational field that, by hypothesis, orders\neverything in the natural world in which we humans and our minds exist?\nThat is the mind-body problem today. In short, phenomenology by any\nother name lies at the heart of the contemporary mind-body problem. \n\nAfter Ryle, philosophers sought a more explicit and generally\nnaturalistic ontology of mind. In the 1950s materialism was argued\nanew, urging that mental states are identical with states of the\ncentral nervous system. The classical identity theory holds that each\ntoken mental state (in a particular person\u2019s mind at a particular time)\nis identical with a token brain state (in that person\u2019s brain at that\ntime). A stronger materialism holds, instead, that each type of mental\nstate is identical with a type of brain state. But materialism does not\nfit comfortably with phenomenology. For it is not obvious how conscious\nmental states as we experience them\u2014sensations, thoughts,\nemotions\u2014can simply be the complex neural states that somehow\nsubserve or implement them. If mental states and neural states are\nsimply identical, in token or in type, where in our scientific theory\nof mind does the phenomenology occur\u2014is it not simply replaced\nby neuroscience? And yet experience is part of what is to be explained\nby neuroscience. \n\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s the computer model of mind set in, and\nfunctionalism became the dominant model of mind. On this model, mind is\nnot what the brain consists in (electrochemical transactions in neurons\nin vast complexes). Instead, mind is what brains do: their function of\nmediating between information coming into the organism and behavior\nproceeding from the organism. Thus, a mental state is a functional\nstate of the brain or of the human (or animal) organism. More\nspecifically, on a favorite variation of functionalism, the mind is a\ncomputing system: mind is to brain as software is to hardware; thoughts\nare just programs running on the brain\u2019s \u201cwetware\u201d. Since\nthe 1970s the cognitive sciences\u2014from experimental studies of\ncognition to neuroscience\u2014have tended toward a mix of\nmaterialism and functionalism. Gradually, however, philosophers found\nthat phenomenological aspects of the mind pose problems for the\nfunctionalist paradigm too. \n\nIn the early 1970s Thomas Nagel argued in \u201cWhat Is It Like to\nBe a Bat?\u201d (1974) that consciousness itself\u2014especially\nthe subjective character of what it is like to have a certain type of\nexperience\u2014escapes physical theory. Many philosophers pressed\nthe case that sensory qualia\u2014what it is like to feel pain, to\nsee red, etc.\u2014are not addressed or explained by a physical\naccount of either brain structure or brain function. Consciousness has\nproperties of its own. And yet, we know, it is closely tied to the\nbrain. And, at some level of description, neural activities implement\ncomputation. \n\nIn the 1980s John Searle argued in Intentionality (1983) (and\nfurther in The Rediscovery of the Mind (1991)) that intentionality and\nconsciousness are essential properties of mental states. For Searle,\nour brains produce mental states with properties of consciousness and\nintentionality, and this is all part of our biology, yet consciousness\nand intentionality require a \u201cfirst-person\u201d ontology.\nSearle also argued that computers simulate but do not have mental\nstates characterized by intentionality. As Searle argued, a computer\nsystem has a syntax (processing symbols of certain shapes) but has no\nsemantics (the symbols lack meaning: we interpret the symbols). In this\nway Searle rejected both materialism and functionalism, while insisting\nthat mind is a biological property of organisms like us: our brains\n\u201csecrete\u201d consciousness. \n\nThe analysis of consciousness and intentionality is central to\nphenomenology as appraised above, and Searle\u2019s theory of intentionality\nreads like a modernized version of Husserl\u2019s. (Contemporary logical\ntheory takes the form of stating truth conditions for propositions, and\nSearle characterizes a mental state\u2019s intentionality by specifying its\n\u201csatisfaction conditions\u201d). However, there is an important\ndifference in background theory. For Searle explicitly assumes the\nbasic worldview of natural science, holding that consciousness is part\nof nature. But Husserl explicitly brackets that assumption, and later\nphenomenologists\u2014including Heidegger, Sartre, \nMerleau-Ponty\u2014seem to seek a certain sanctuary for phenomenology beyond the\nnatural sciences. And yet phenomenology itself should be largely\nneutral about further theories of how experience arises, notably from\nbrain activity. \n\nSince the late 1980s, and especially the late 1990s, a variety of\nwriters working in philosophy of mind have focused on the fundamental\ncharacter of consciousness, ultimately a phenomenological issue. Does\nconsciousness always and essentially involve self-consciousness, or\nconsciousness-of-consciousness, as Brentano, Husserl, and Sartre held\n(in varying detail)? If so, then every act of consciousness either\nincludes or is adjoined by a consciousness-of-that-consciousness. Does\nthat self-consciousness take the form of an internal self-monitoring?\nIf so, is that monitoring of a higher order, where each act of\nconsciousness is joined by a further mental act monitoring the base\nact? Or is such monitoring of the same order as the base act, a proper\npart of the act without which the act would not be conscious? A variety\nof models of this self-consciousness have been developed, some\nexplicitly drawing on or adapting views in Brentano, Husserl, and\nSartre. Two recent collections address these issues: David Woodruff\nSmith and Amie L. Thomasson (editors), Phenomenology and Philosophy of\nMind (2005), and Uriah Kriegel and Kenneth Williford (editors),\nSelf-Representational Approaches to Consciousness (2006). \n\nThe philosophy of mind may be factored into the following\ndisciplines or ranges of theory relevant to mind: \n\nThis division of labor in the theory of mind can be seen as an\nextension of Brentano\u2019s original distinction between descriptive and\ngenetic psychology. Phenomenology offers descriptive analyses of mental\nphenomena, while neuroscience (and wider biology and ultimately\nphysics) offers models of explanation of what causes or gives rise to\nmental phenomena. Cultural theory offers analyses of social activities\nand their impact on experience, including ways language shapes our\nthought, emotion, and motivation. And ontology frames all these results\nwithin a basic scheme of the structure of the world, including our own\nminds. \n\nThe ontological distinction among the form, appearance, and substrate\nof an activity of consciousness is detailed in D. W. Smith, Mind World\n(2004), in the essay \u201cThree Facets of Consciousness\u201d. \n\nMeanwhile, from an epistemological standpoint, all these ranges of\ntheory about mind begin with how we observe and reason about and seek\nto explain phenomena we encounter in the world. And that is where\nphenomenology begins. Moreover, how we understand each piece of\ntheory, including theory about mind, is central to the theory of\nintentionality, as it were, the semantics of thought and experience in\ngeneral. And that is the heart of phenomenology. \n\nPhenomenological issues, by any other name, have played a prominent\nrole in very recent philosophy of mind. Amplifying the theme of the\nprevious section, we note two such issues: the form of inner awareness\nthat ostensibly makes a mental activity conscious, and the phenomenal\ncharacter of conscious cognitive mental activity in thought, and\nperception, and action. \n\nEver since Nagel\u2019s 1974 article, \u201cWhat Is It Like to be a Bat?\u201d, the\nnotion of what-it-is-like to experience a mental state or activity has\nposed a challenge to reductive materialism and functionalism in theory\nof mind. This subjective phenomenal character of consciousness is held\nto be constitutive or definitive of consciousness. What is the form of\nthat phenomenal character we find in consciousness? \n\nA prominent line of analysis holds that the phenomenal character of\na mental activity consists in a certain form of awareness of that\nactivity, an awareness that by definition renders it conscious. Since\nthe 1980s a variety of models of that awareness have been developed. As\nnoted above, there are models that define this awareness as a\nhigher-order monitoring, either an inner perception of the activity (a\nform of inner sense per Kant) or inner consciousness (per Brentano), or\nan inner thought about the activity. A further model analyzes such\nawareness as an integral part of the experience, a form of\nself-representation within the experience. (Again, see Kriegel and\nWilliford (eds.) (2006).) \n\nA somewhat different model comes arguably closer to the form of\nself-consciousness sought by Brentano, Husserl, and Sartre. On the\n\u201cmodal\u201d model, inner awareness of an experience takes the form of an\nintegral reflexive awareness of \u201cthis very experience\u201d. That form of\nawareness is held to be a constitutive element of the experience that\nrenders it conscious. As Sartre put the claim, self-consciousness is\nconstitutive of consciousness, but that self-consciousness is\n\u201cpre-reflective\u201d. This reflexive awareness is not, then, part of a\nseparable higher-order monitoring, but rather built into consciousness\nper se. On the modal model, this awareness is part of the way the\nexperience unfolds: subjectively, phenomenally, consciously. This model\nis elaborated in D. W. Smith (2004), Mind World, in the essay \u201cReturn\nto Consciousness\u201d (and elsewhere). \n\nWhatever may be the precise form of phenomenal character, we would\nask how that character distributes over mental life. What is phenomenal\nin different types of mental activity? Here arise issues of cognitive\nphenomenology. Is phenomenality restricted to the \u201cfeel\u201d of sensory\nexperience? Or is phenomenality present also in cognitive experiences of\nthinking such-and-such, or of perception bearing conceptual as well as\nsensory content, or also in volitional or conative bodily action? These\nissues are explored in Bayne and Montague (eds.) (2011), Cognitive\nPhenomenology. \n\nA restrictive view holds that only sensory experience has a proper\nphenomenal character, a what-it-is-like. Seeing a color, hearing a\ntone, smelling an odor, feeling a pain\u2014these types of\nconscious experience have a phenomenal character, but no others do, on\nthis view.  A stringent empiricism might limit phenomenal experience\nto pure sensations, though Hume himself presumably recognized\nphenomenal \u201cideas\u201d beyond pure sense\n\u201cimpressions\u201d. A somewhat more expansive view would hold\nthat perceptual experience has a distinctive phenomenal character even\nwhere sensation is informed by concepts. Seeing that yellow canary,\nhearing that clear Middle C on a Steinway piano, smelling the sharp\nodor of anise, feeling a pain of the jab of the doctor\u2019s needle in\nreceiving an injection\u2014these types of conscious experience\nhave a character of what-it-is-like, a character informed by\nconceptual content that is also \u201cfelt\u201d, on this view. A\nKantian account of conceptual-sensory experience, or\n\u201cintuition\u201d, would endorse a phenomenal character in these\ntypes of experience. Indeed, \u201cphenomena\u201d, in the Kantian\nidiom, are precisely things as they appear in consciousness, so of\ncourse their appearance has a phenomenal character. \n\nNow, a much more expansive view would hold that every conscious\nexperience has a distinctive phenomenal character. Thinking that 17 is\na prime number, thinking that the red in the sunset is caused by the\nsun\u2019s light waves being bent by the atmosphere, thinking that Kant was\nmore right than Hume about the grounds of knowledge, thinking that\neconomic principles are also political\u2014even such highly\ncognitive activities have a character of what-it-is-like to so think,\naccording to this expansive view. \n\nClassical phenomenologists like Husserl and Merleau-Ponty surely\nassumed an expansive view of phenomenal consciousness. As noted above,\nthe \u201cphenomena\u201d that are the focus of phenomenology were\nassumed to present a rich character of lived experience. Even\nHeidegger, while de-emphasizing consciousness (the Cartesian sin!),\ndwelt on \u201cphenomena\u201d as what appears or shows up to us (to\n\u201cDasein\u201d) in our everyday activities such as hammering a\nnail. Like Merleau-Ponty, Gurwitsch (1964) explicitly studies the\n\u201cphenomenal field\u201d, embracing all that is presented in our\nexperience. Arguably, for these thinkers, every type of conscious\nexperience has its distinctive phenomenal character, its\n\u201cphenomenology\u201d\u2014and the task of phenomenology (the\ndiscipline) is to analyze that character. Note that in recent debates\nthe phenomenal character of an experience is often called its\n\u201cphenomenology\u201d\u2014whereas, in the established idiom,\nthe term \u201cphenomenology\u201d names the discipline that studies\nsuch \u201cphenomenology\u201d. \n\nSince intentionality is a crucial property of consciousness,\naccording to Brentano, Husserl, et al., the character of intentionality\nitself would count as phenomenal, as part of what-it-is-like to\nexperience a given type of intentional experience. But it is not only\nintentional perception and thought that have their distinctive\nphenomenal characters. Embodied action also would have a distinctive\nphenomenal character, involving \u201clived\u201d characters of kinesthetic\nsensation as well as conceptual volitional content, say, in the feel of\nkicking a soccer ball. The \u201clived body\u201d is precisely the body as\nexperienced in everyday embodied volitional action such as running or\nkicking a ball or even speaking. Husserl wrote at length about the\n\u201clived body\u201d (Leib), in Ideas II, and Merleau-Ponty followed suit with\nrich analyses of embodied perception and action, in Phenomenology of\nPerception. In Bayne and Montague (eds.) (2011) see the article on\nconative phenomenology by Terence Horgan, and in Smith and Thomasson\n(eds.) (2005) see articles by Charles Siewert and Sean Kelly. \n\nBut now a problems remains. Intentionality essentially involves\nmeaning, so the question arises how meaning appears in phenomenal\ncharacter. Importantly, the content of a conscious experience typically\ncarries a horizon of background meaning, meaning that is largely\nimplicit rather than explicit in experience. But then a wide range of\ncontent carried by an experience would not have a consciously felt\nphenomenal character. So it may well be argued.

        "the first person AND the elliptical orbits",
        "In the black dome of night, the stars seem fixed in their patterns. They rotate through the sky over the seasons so unchangingly that most cultures have used the presence of one or another constellation to tell time. The planets, however, are different, puzzling. They glide slowly and seemingly erratically across the sky. Attempts to explain why the planets move as they do led to modern science\u2019s understanding of gravity and motion. \u201cWe revolve around the Sun like any other planet.\u201d \u2014Nicolaus Copernicus \u201cOf all discoveries and opinions, none may have exerted a greater effect on the human spirit than the doctrine of Copernicus. The world has scarcely become known as round and complete in itself when it was asked to waive the tremendous privilege of being the center of the universe.\u201d \u2014Johann Wolfgang von Goethe The ancient Greek philosophers, whose ideas shaped the worldview of Western Civilization leading up to the Scientific Revolution in the sixteenth century, had conflicting theories about why the planets moved across the sky. One camp thought that the planets orbited around the Sun, but Aristotle, whose ideas prevailed, believed that the planets and the Sun orbited Earth. He saw no sign that the Earth was in motion: no perpetual wind blew over the surface of the Earth, and a ball thrown straight up into the air doesn\u2019t land behind the thrower, as Aristotle assumed it would if the Earth were moving. For Aristotle, this meant that the Earth had to be stationary, and the planets, the Sun, and the fixed dome of stars rotated around Earth. For nearly 1,000 years, Aristotle\u2019s view of a stationary Earth at the center of a revolving universe dominated natural philosophy, the name that scholars of the time used for studies of the physical world. A geocentric worldview became engrained in Christian theology, making it a doctrine of religion as much as natural philosophy. Despite that, it was a priest who brought back the idea that the Earth moves around the Sun. In 1515, a Polish priest named Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that the Earth was a planet like Venus or Saturn, and that all planets circled the Sun. Afraid of criticism (some scholars think Copernicus was more concerned about scientific shortcomings of his theories than he was about the Church\u2019s disapproval), he did not publish his theory until 1543, shortly before his death. The theory gathered few followers, and for a time, some of those who did give credence to the idea faced charges of heresy. Italian scientist Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for teaching, among other heretical ideas, Copernicus\u2019 heliocentric view of the Universe. But the evidence for a heliocentric solar system gradually mounted. When Galileo pointed his telescope into the night sky in 1610, he saw for the first time in human history that moons orbited Jupiter. If Aristotle were right about all things orbiting Earth, then these moons could not exist. Galileo also observed the phases of Venus, which proved that the planet orbits the Sun. While Galileo did not share Bruno\u2019s fate, he was tried for heresy under the Roman Inquisition and placed under house arrest for life. At about the same time, German mathematician Johannes Kepler was publishing a series of laws that describe the orbits of the planets around the Sun. Still in use today, the mathematical equations provided accurate predictions of the planets\u2019 movement under Copernican theory. In 1687,  Isaac Newton put the final nail in the coffin for the Aristotelian, geocentric view of the Universe. Building on Kepler\u2019s laws, Newton explained why the planets moved as they did around the Sun and he gave the force that kept them in check a name: gravity. While Copernicus rightly observed that the planets revolve around the Sun, it was Kepler who correctly defined their orbits. At the age of 27, Kepler became the assistant of a wealthy astronomer, Tycho Brahe, who asked him to define the orbit of Mars. Brahe had collected a lifetime of astronomical observations, which, on his death, passed into Kepler\u2019s hands. (Brahe, who had his own Earth-centered model of the Universe, withheld the bulk of his observations from Kepler at least in part because he did not want Kepler to use them to prove Copernican theory correct.) Using these observations, Kepler found that the orbits of the planets followed three laws. Like many philosophers of his era, Kepler had a mystical belief that the circle was the Universe\u2019s perfect shape, and that as a manifestation of Divine order, the planets\u2019 orbits must be circular. For many years, he struggled to make Brahe\u2019s observations of the motions of Mars match up with a circular orbit.  Eventually, however, Kepler noticed that an imaginary line drawn from a planet to the Sun swept out an equal area of space in equal times, regardless of where the planet was in its orbit. If you draw a triangle out from the Sun to a planet\u2019s position at one point in time and its position at a fixed time later\u2014say, 5 hours, or 2 days\u2014the area of that triangle is always the same, anywhere in the orbit. For all these triangles to have the same area, the planet must move more quickly when it is near the Sun, but more slowly when it is farthest from the Sun. This discovery (which became Kepler\u2019s second law of orbital motion) led to the realization of what became Kepler\u2019s first law: that the planets move in an ellipse (a squashed circle) with the Sun at one focus point, offset from the center. Kepler\u2019s third law shows that there is a precise mathematical relationship between a planet\u2019s distance from the Sun and the amount of time it takes revolve around the Sun. It was this law that inspired Newton, who came up with three laws of his own to explain why the planets move as they do. If Kepler\u2019s laws define the motion of the planets, Newton\u2019s laws define motion. Thinking on Kepler\u2019s laws, Newton realized that all motion, whether it was the orbit of the Moon around the Earth or an apple falling from a tree, followed the same basic principles. \u201cTo the same natural effects,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.\u201d Previous Aristotelian thinking,  physicist Stephen Hawking has written, assigned different causes to different types of motion. By unifying all motion, Newton shifted the scientific perspective to a search for large, unifying patterns in nature. Newton outlined his laws in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (\u201cMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,\u201d) published in 1687. Law I. Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed theron. In essence, a moving object won\u2019t change speed or direction, nor will a still object start moving, unless some outside force acts on it. The law is regularly summed up in one word: inertia. Law II. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. Newton\u2019s second law is most recognizable in its mathematical form, the iconic equation: F=ma. The strength of the force (F) is defined by how much it changes the motion (acceleration, a) of an object with some mass (m). Law III. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. As Newton himself described: \u201cIf you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone.\u201d Within the pages of Principia, Newton also presented his law of universal gravitation as a case study of his laws of motion. All matter exerts a force, which he called gravity, that pulls all other matter towards its center. The strength of the force depends on the mass of the object: the Sun has more gravity than Earth, which in turn has more gravity than an apple. Also, the force weakens with distance. Objects far from the Sun won\u2019t be influenced by its gravity. Newton\u2019s laws of motion and gravity explained Earth\u2019s annual journey around the Sun. Earth would move straight forward through the universe, but the Sun exerts a constant pull on our planet. This force bends Earth\u2019s path toward the Sun, pulling the planet into an elliptical (almost circular) orbit.  His theories also made it possible to explain and predict the tides. The rise and fall of ocean water levels are created by the gravitational pull of the Moon as it orbits Earth. The ideas outlined in Newton\u2019s laws of motion and universal gravitation stood unchallenged for nearly 220 years until Albert Einstein presented his theory of special relativity in 1905. Newton\u2019s theory depended on the assumption that mass, time, and distance are constant regardless of where you measure them. The theory of relativity treats time, space, and mass as fluid things, defined by an observer\u2019s frame of reference. All of us moving through the universe on the Earth are in a single frame of reference, but an astronaut in a fast-moving spaceship would be in a different reference frame. Within a single frame of reference, the laws of classical physics, including Newton\u2019s laws, hold true. But Newton\u2019s laws can\u2019t explain the differences in motion, mass, distance, and time that result when objects are observed from two very different frames of reference. To describe motion in these situations, scientists must rely on Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. At slow speeds and at large scales, however, the differences in time, length, and mass predicted by relativity are small enough that they appear to be constant, and Newton\u2019s laws still work. In general, few things are moving at speeds fast enough for us to notice relativity.  For large, slow-moving satellites, Newton\u2019s laws still define orbits. We can still use them to launch Earth-observing satellites and predict their motion. We can use them to reach the Moon, Mars, and other places beyond Earth. For this reason, many scientists see Einstein\u2019s laws of general and special relativity not as a replacement of Newton\u2019s laws of motion and universal gravitation, but as the full culmination of his idea. \nLand\n \nLand\n"

        "the first person AND the elliptical orbits",
        "\nKepler's three laws describe how planetary bodies orbit the Sun. They describe how (1) planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun as a focus, (2) a planet covers the same area of space in the same amount of time no matter where it is in its orbit, and (3) a planet\u2019s orbital period is proportional to the size of its orbit (its semi-major axis).\n Explore the process that Johannes Kepler undertook when he formulated his three laws of planetary motion. The planets orbit the Sun in a counterclockwise direction as viewed from above the Sun's north pole, and the planets' orbits all are aligned to what astronomers call the ecliptic plane. The story of our greater understanding of planetary motion could not be told if it were not for the work of a German mathematician named Johannes Kepler. Kepler lived in Graz, Austria during the tumultuous early 17th century. Due to religious and political difficulties common during that era, Kepler was banished from Graz on August 2nd, 1600. Fortunately, an opportunity to work as an assistant for the famous astronomer Tycho Brahe presented itself and the young Kepler moved his family from Graz 300 miles across the Danube River to Brahe's home in Prague. Tycho Brahe is credited with the most accurate astronomical observations of his time and was impressed with the studies of Kepler during an earlier meeting. However, Brahe mistrusted Kepler, fearing that his bright young intern might eclipse him as the premier astronomer of his day. He, therefore, led Kepler to see only part of his voluminous planetary data. He set Kepler, the task of understanding the orbit of the planet Mars, the movement of which fit problematically into the universe as described by Aristotle and Ptolemy. It is believed that part of the motivation for giving the Mars problem to Kepler was Brahe's hope that its difficulty would occupy Kepler while Brahe worked to perfect his own theory of the solar system, which was based on a geocentric model, where the earth is the center of the solar system. Based on this model, the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn all orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the earth. As it turned out, Kepler, unlike Brahe, believed firmly in the Copernican model of the solar system known as heliocentric, which correctly placed the Sun at its center. But the reason Mars' orbit was problematic was because the Copernican system incorrectly assumed the orbits of the planets to be circular. After much struggling, Kepler was forced to an eventual realization that the orbits of the planets are not circles, but were instead the elongated or flattened circles that geometers call ellipses, and the particular difficulties Brahe hand with the movement of Mars were due to the fact that its orbit was the most elliptical of the planets for which Brahe had extensive data. Thus, in a twist of irony, Brahe unwittingly gave Kepler the very part of his data that would enable Kepler to formulate the correct theory of the solar system, banishing Brahe's own theory. Since the orbits of the planets are ellipses, let us review three basic properties of ellipses. The first property of an ellipse: an ellipse is defined by two points, each called a focus, and together called foci. The sum of the distances to the foci from any point on the ellipse is always a constant. The second property of an ellipse: the amount of flattening of the ellipse is called the eccentricity. The flatter the ellipse, the more eccentric it is. Each ellipse has an eccentricity with a value between zero, a circle, and one, essentially a flat line, technically called a parabola. The third property of an ellipse: the longest axis of the ellipse is called the major axis, while the shortest axis is called the minor axis. Half of the major axis is termed a semi-major axis. Knowing then that the orbits of the planets are elliptical, johannes Kepler formulated three laws of planetary motion, which accurately described the motion of comets as well. Kepler's First Law: each planet's orbit about the Sun is an ellipse. The Sun's center is always located at one focus of the orbital ellipse. The Sun is at one focus. The planet follows the ellipse in its orbit, meaning that the planet to Sun distance is constantly changing as the planet goes around its orbit. Kepler's Second Law: the imaginary line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps equal areas of space during equal time intervals as the planet orbits. Basically, that planets do not move with constant speed along their orbits. Rather, their speed varies so that the line joining the centers of the Sun and the planet sweeps out equal parts of an area in equal times. The point of nearest approach of the planet to the Sun is termed perihelion. The point of greatest separation is aphelion, hence by Kepler's Second Law, a planet is moving fastest when it is at perihelion and slowest at aphelion. Kepler's Third Law: the squares of the orbital periods of the planets are directly proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axes of their orbits. Kepler's Third Law implies that the period for a planet to orbit the Sun increases rapidly with the radius of its orbit. Thus we find that Mercury, the innermost planet, takes only 88 days to orbit the Sun. The earth takes 365 days, while Saturn requires 10,759 days to do the same. Though Kepler hadn't known about gravitation when he came up with his three laws, they were instrumental in Isaac Newton deriving his theory of universal gravitation, which explains the unknown force behind Kepler's Third Law. Kepler and his theories were crucial in the better understanding of our solar system dynamics and as a springboard to newer theories that more accurately approximate our planetary orbits. \nPREVIEW\n \nEmbed this resource by pasting the following code into your website:\n \nScience Writers: \nPhil Davis & Steve Carney\n\nSocial Media Lead: \nBill Dunford\n\nDesign & Development: \nMoore Boeck\n\n \nSite last updated: June 23, 2023\n"

        "the first person AND the elliptical orbits",
        "Heliocentrism[a] (also known as the Heliocentric model) is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the universe. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the third century BC by Aristarchus of Samos,[1] who had been influenced by a concept presented by Philolaus of Croton (c. 470 \u2013 385 BC). In the 5th century BC the Greek Philosophers Philolaus and Hicetas had the thought on different occasions that the Earth was spherical and revolving around a \"mystical\" central fire, and that this fire regulated the universe.[2] In medieval Europe, however, Aristarchus' heliocentrism attracted little attention\u2014possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic period.[b]\n It was not until the sixteenth century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric, Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution. In the following century, Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope.\n With the observations of William Herschel, Friedrich Bessel, and other astronomers, it was realized that the Sun, while near the barycenter of the Solar System, was not at any center of the universe.\n While the sphericity of the Earth was widely recognized in Greco-Roman astronomy from at least the 4th century BC,[4] the Earth's daily rotation and yearly orbit around the Sun was never universally accepted until the Copernican Revolution.\n While a moving Earth was proposed at least from the 4th century BC in Pythagoreanism, and a fully developed heliocentric model was developed by Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, these ideas were not successful in replacing the view of a static spherical Earth, and from the 2nd century AD the predominant model, which would be inherited by medieval astronomy, was the geocentric model described in Ptolemy's Almagest.\n The Ptolemaic system was a sophisticated astronomical system that managed to calculate the positions for the planets to a fair degree of accuracy.[5]\nPtolemy himself, in his Almagest, says that any model for describing the motions of the planets is merely a mathematical device, and since there is no actual way to know which is true, the simplest model that gets the right numbers should be used.[6]\nHowever, he rejected the idea of a spinning Earth as absurd as he believed it would create huge winds. Within his model the distances of the Moon, Sun, planets and stars could be determined by treating orbits' celestial spheres as contiguous realities, which gave the stars' distance as less than 20 Astronomical Units,[7] a regression, since Aristarchus of Samos's heliocentric scheme had centuries earlier necessarily placed the stars at least two orders of magnitude more distant.\n Problems with Ptolemy's system were well recognized in medieval astronomy, and an increasing effort to criticize and improve it in the late medieval period eventually led to the Copernican heliocentrism developed in Renaissance astronomy.\n The non-geocentric model of the universe was proposed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus (d. 390 BC), who taught that at the center of the universe was a \"central fire\", around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and planets revolved in uniform circular motion. This system postulated the existence of a counter-earth collinear with the Earth and central fire, with the same period of revolution around the central fire as the Earth. The Sun revolved around the central fire once a year, and the stars were stationary. The Earth maintained the same hidden face towards the central fire, rendering both it and the \"counter-earth\" invisible from Earth. The Pythagorean concept of uniform circular motion remained unchallenged for approximately the next 2000 years, and it was to the Pythagoreans that Copernicus referred to show that the notion of a moving Earth was neither new nor revolutionary.[8] Kepler gave an alternative explanation of the Pythagoreans' \"central fire\" as the Sun, \"as most sects purposely hid[e] their teachings\".[9]\n Heraclides of Pontus (4th century BC) said that the rotation of the Earth explained the apparent daily motion of the celestial sphere. It used to be thought that he believed Mercury and Venus to revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth.[10] Macrobius (AD 395\u2014423) later described this as the \"Egyptian System,\" stating that \"it did not escape the skill of the Egyptians,\" though there is no other evidence it was known in ancient Egypt.[11][12]\n The first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system was Aristarchus of Samos (c.\u2009270 BC). Like his contemporary Eratosthenes, Aristarchus calculated the size of the Earth and measured the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon. From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than the Earth, and thought that the larger object would have the most attractive force.\n His writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information about them is known from a brief description by his contemporary, Archimedes, and from scattered references by later writers. Archimedes' description of Aristarchus' theory is given in the former's book, The Sand Reckoner. The entire description comprises just three sentences, which Thomas Heath translates as follows:[13]\n You [King Gelon] are aware that \"universe\" is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere, the centre of which is the centre of the earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the centre of the sun and the centre of the earth.  This is the common account (\u03c4\u03ac \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1), as you have heard from astronomers.  But Aristarchus brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the \"universe\" just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved, that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle, the sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same centre as the sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the centre of the sphere bears to its surface. Aristarchus presumably took the stars to be very far away because he was aware that their parallax[14] would otherwise be observed over the course of a year. The stars are in fact so far away that stellar parallax only became detectable when sufficiently powerful telescopes had been developed in the 1830s.\n No references to Aristarchus' heliocentrism are known in any other writings from before the common era. The earliest of the handful of other ancient references occur in two passages from the writings of Plutarch. These mention one detail not stated explicitly in Archimedes' account[15]\u2014namely, that Aristarchus' theory had the Earth rotating on an axis. The first of these reference occurs in On the Face in the Orb of the Moon:[16]\n Only do not, my good fellow, enter an action against me for impiety in the style of Cleanthes, who thought it was the duty of Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe, this being the effect of his attempt to save the phenomena by supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis. Only scattered fragments of Cleanthes' writings have survived in quotations by other writers, but in Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius lists A reply to Aristarchus (\u03a0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd) as one of Cleanthes' works,[17] and some scholars[18] have suggested that this might have been where Cleanthes had accused Aristarchus of impiety.\n The second of the references by Plutarch is in his Platonic Questions:[19]\n Did Plato put the earth in motion, as he did the sun, the moon, and the five planets, which he called the instruments of time on account of their turnings, and was it necessary to conceive that the earth \"which is globed about the axis stretched from pole to pole through the whole universe\" was not represented as being held together and at rest, but as turning and revolving (\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c6\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd), as Aristarchus and Seleucus afterwards maintained that it did, the former stating this as only a hypothesis (\u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd), the latter as a definite opinion (\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2)? The remaining references to Aristarchus' heliocentrism are extremely brief, and provide no more information beyond what can be gleaned from those already cited. Ones which mention Aristarchus explicitly by name occur in A\u00ebtius' Opinions of the Philosophers, Sextus Empiricus' Against the Mathematicians,[19] and an anonymous scholiast to Aristotle.[20] Another passage in A\u00ebtius' Opinions of the Philosophers reports that Seleucus the astronomer had affirmed the Earth's motion, but does not mention Aristarchus.[19]\n Since Plutarch mentions the \"followers of Aristarchus\" in passing, it is likely that there were other astronomers in the Classical period who also espoused heliocentrism, but whose work was lost. The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC), a Hellenistic astronomer who flourished a century after Aristarchus in the Seleucid Empire.[21] Seleucus was a proponent of the heliocentric system of Aristarchus.[22] Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model for the heliocentric theory and developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model. He may have used early trigonometric methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus.[23] A fragment of a work by Seleucus has survived in Arabic translation, which was referred to by Rhazes (b. 865).[24]\n Alternatively, his explanation may have involved the phenomenon of tides,[25] which he supposedly theorized to be caused by the attraction to the Moon and by the revolution of the Earth around the Earth and Moon's center of mass.\n There were occasional speculations about heliocentrism in Europe before Copernicus. In Roman Carthage, the pagan Martianus Capella (5th century A.D.) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about the Earth but instead circled the Sun.[26] Capella's model was discussed in the Early Middle Ages by various anonymous 9th-century commentators[27] and Copernicus mentions him as an influence on his own work.[28]\n The Tamil classical literary work Ci\u1e5fup\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e5f\u1e5fuppa\u1e6dai from c. 3rd century CE by Nattatta\u1e49\u0101r uses \"the sun being orbited by planets\" as an analogy for food served by a king in golden plates surrounded by sides.[29][30] \nThe Ptolemaic system was also received in Indian astronomy[citation needed]. Aryabhata (476\u2013550), in his magnum opus Aryabhatiya (499), propounded a planetary model in which the Earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the Sun.[31] His immediate commentators, such as Lalla, and other later authors, rejected his innovative view about the turning Earth.[32] He also made many astronomical calculations, such as the times of the solar and lunar eclipses, and the instantaneous motion of the Moon.[33] Early followers of Aryabhata's model included Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara II.\n The Aitareya Brahmana (dated to 500 BCE or older) states that \"The sun does never set nor rise. When people think the sun is setting (it is not so).\"[34][35]\n For a time, Muslim astronomers accepted the Ptolemaic system and the geocentric model, which were used by al-Battani to show that the distance between the Sun and the Earth varies.[36][37] In the 10th century, al-Sijzi accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis.[38][39] According to later astronomer al-Biruni, al-Sijzi invented an astrolabe called al-z\u016braq\u012b based on a belief held by some of his contemporaries that the apparent motion of the stars was due to the Earth's movement, and not that of the firmament.[39][40] Islamic astronomers began to criticize the Ptolemaic model, including Ibn al-Haytham in his Al-Shuk\u016bk 'al\u0101 Ba\u1e6dalamiy\u016bs (\"Doubts Concerning Ptolemy\", c. 1028),[41][42] who branded it an impossibility.[43]\n Al-Biruni discussed the possibility of whether the Earth rotated about its own axis and orbited the Sun, but in his Masudic Canon (1031),[44] he expressed his faith in a geocentric and stationary Earth.[45] He was aware that if the Earth rotated on its axis, it would be consistent with his astronomical observations,[46] but considered it a problem of natural philosophy rather than one of mathematics.[39][47]\n In the 12th century, non-heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers, such as Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji, who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical, and not physical.[48][49] His system spread throughout most of Europe in the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century.[49]\n The Maragha school of astronomy in Ilkhanid-era Persia further developed \"non-Ptolemaic\" planetary models involving Earth's rotation. Notable astronomers of this school are Al-Urdi (d. 1266) Al-Katibi (d. 1277),[50] and Al-Tusi (d. 1274).\n The arguments and evidence used resemble those used by Copernicus to support the Earth's motion.[51][52]\nThe criticism of Ptolemy as developed by Averroes and by the Maragha school explicitly address the Earth's rotation but it did not arrive at explicit heliocentrism.[53]\nThe observations of the Maragha school were further improved at the Timurid-era Samarkand observatory under Qushji (1403\u20131474).\n European scholarship in the later medieval period actively received astronomical models developed in the Islamic world and by the 13th century was well aware of the problems of the Ptolemaic model. In the 14th century, bishop Nicole Oresme discussed the possibility that the Earth rotated on its axis, while Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa in his Learned Ignorance asked whether there was any reason to assert that the Sun (or any other point) was the center of the universe. In parallel to a mystical definition of God, Cusa wrote that \"Thus the fabric of the world (machina mundi) will quasi have its center everywhere and circumference nowhere,\"[54] recalling Hermes Trismegistus.[55]\n In India, Nilakantha Somayaji (1444\u20131544), in his Aryabhatiyabhasya, a commentary on Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, developed a computational system for a geo-heliocentric planetary model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the system later proposed by Tycho Brahe. In the Tantrasamgraha (1501), Somayaji further revised his planetary system, which was mathematically more accurate at predicting the heliocentric orbits of the interior planets than both the Tychonic and Copernican models,[56][57] but did not propose any specific models of the universe.[58] Nilakantha's planetary system also incorporated the Earth's rotation on its axis.[59] Most astronomers of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics seem to have accepted his planetary model.[60][61]\n Some historians maintain that the thought of the Maragheh observatory, in particular the mathematical devices known as the Urdi lemma and the Tusi couple, influenced Renaissance-era European astronomy, and thus was indirectly received by Renaissance-era European astronomy and thus by Copernicus.[47][62][63][64][65]\nCopernicus used such devices in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources.[66] The exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the Commentariolus was found in an earlier work by Ibn al-Shatir (d. c. 1375) of Damascus.[67] Copernicus' lunar and Mercury models are also identical to Ibn al-Shatir's.[68]\n While the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit, the claim of direct influence of the\nMaragha school, postulated by Otto E. Neugebauer in 1957, remains an open question.[53][69][70][citation needed] Since the Tusi couple was used by Copernicus in his reformulation of mathematical astronomy, there is a growing consensus that he became aware of this idea in some way. One possible route of transmission may have been through Byzantine science, which translated some of al-Tusi's works from Arabic into Byzantine Greek. Several Byzantine Greek manuscripts containing the Tusi couple are still extant in Italy.[71] The Mathematics Genealogy Project suggests that there is a \"geneaology\" of Nasir al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b \u2192 Shams al\u2010D\u012bn al\u2010Bukh\u0101r\u012b \u2192 Gregory Chioniades \u2192 Manuel Bryennios \u2192 Theodore Metochites \u2192 Gregory Palamas \u2192 Nilos Kabasilas \u2192 Demetrios Kydones \u2192 Gemistos Plethon \u2192 Basilios Bessarion \u2192 Johannes Regiomontanus \u2192 Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara \u2192 Nicolaus (Miko\u0142aj Kopernik) Copernicus.[72] Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) wrote \"Il sole non si move.\" (\"The Sun does not move.\")[73] and he was a student of a student of Bessarion according to the Mathematics Genealogy Project. [74] It has been suggested that the idea of the Tusi couple may have arrived in Europe leaving few manuscript traces, since it could have occurred without the translation of any Arabic text into Latin.[75][47]\n Other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition.[76][77][78][79] Copernicus explicitly references several astronomers of the \"Islamic Golden Age\" (10th to 12th centuries) in De Revolutionibus: Albategnius (Al-Battani), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), Thebit (Thabit Ibn Qurra), Arzachel (Al-Zarqali), and Alpetragius (Al-Bitruji), but he does not show awareness of the existence of any of the later astronomers of the Maragha school.[80]\n It has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from Proclus's Commentary on the First Book of Euclid,[81] which Copernicus cited.[82]\nAnother possible source for Copernicus's knowledge of this mathematical device is the Questiones de Spera of Nicole Oresme, who described how a reciprocating linear motion of a celestial body could be produced by a combination of circular motions similar to those proposed by al-Tusi.[83]\n The state of knowledge on planetary theory received by Copernicus is summarized in Georg von Peuerbach's Theoricae Novae Planetarum (printed in 1472 by Regiomontanus). By 1470, the accuracy of observations by the Vienna school of astronomy, of which Peuerbach and Regiomontanus were members, was high enough to make the eventual development of heliocentrism inevitable, and indeed it is possible that Regiomontanus did arrive at an explicit theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, some 30 years before Copernicus.[84]\n Nicolaus Copernicus in his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (\"On the revolution of heavenly spheres\", first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his Almagest.\nCopernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets. In doing so, Copernicus moved heliocentrism from philosophical speculation to predictive geometrical astronomy. In reality, Copernicus's system did not predict the planets' positions any better than the Ptolemaic system.[85] This theory resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent, rather than real: it was a parallax effect, as an object that one is passing seems to move backwards against the horizon. This issue was also resolved in the geocentric Tychonic system; the latter, however, while eliminating the major epicycles, retained as a physical reality the irregular back-and-forth motion of the planets, which Kepler characterized as a \"pretzel\".[86]\n Copernicus cited Aristarchus in an early (unpublished) manuscript of De Revolutionibus (which still survives), stating: \"Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion.\"[87] However, in the published version he restricts himself to noting that in works by Cicero he had found an account of the theories of Hicetas and that Plutarch had provided him with an account of the Pythagoreans, Heraclides Ponticus, Philolaus, and Ecphantus. These authors had proposed a moving Earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central sun.\n The first information about the heliocentric views of Nicolaus Copernicus was circulated in manuscript completed some time before May 1, 1514.[88] In 1533, Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered in Rome a series of lectures outlining Copernicus' theory. The lectures were heard with interest by Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals.[89]\n In 1539, Martin Luther said:\n \"There is talk of a new astrologer who wants to prove that the earth moves and goes around instead of the sky, the sun, the moon, just as if somebody were moving in a carriage or ship might hold that he was sitting still and at rest while the earth and the trees walked and moved. But that is how things are nowadays: when a man wishes to be clever he must \u2026 invent something special, and the way he does it must needs be the best! The fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside-down. However, as Holy Scripture tells us, so did Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not the earth.\"[90] This was reported in the context of a conversation at the dinner table and not a formal statement of faith. Melanchthon, however, opposed the doctrine over a period of years.[91][92]\n Nicolaus Copernicus published the definitive statement of his system in De Revolutionibus in 1543. Copernicus began to write it in 1506 and finished it in 1530, but did not publish it until the year of his death. Although he was in good standing with the Church and had dedicated the book to Pope Paul III, the published form contained an unsigned preface by Osiander defending the system and arguing that it was useful for computation even if its hypotheses were not necessarily true. Possibly because of that preface, the work of Copernicus inspired very little debate on whether it might be heretical during the next 60 years. There was an early suggestion among Dominicans that the teaching of heliocentrism should be banned, but nothing came of it at the time.\n Some years after the publication of De Revolutionibus John Calvin preached a sermon in which he denounced those who \"pervert the order of nature\" by saying that \"the sun does not move and that it is the earth that revolves and that it turns\".[93][d]\n Prior to the publication of De Revolutionibus, the most widely accepted system had been proposed by Ptolemy, in which the Earth was the center of the universe and all celestial bodies orbited it. Tycho Brahe, arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, advocated against Copernicus's heliocentric system and for an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system: a geo-heliocentric system now known as the Tychonic system in which the Sun and Moon orbit the Earth, Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun inside the Sun's orbit of the Earth, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun outside the Sun's orbit of the Earth.\n Tycho appreciated the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The Aristotelian physics of the time (modern Newtonian physics was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, whereas it could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made of a different sort substance called aether that moved naturally. So Tycho said that the Copernican system \"... expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.\"[98] Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Aristarchus and Copernicus had assumed in order to explain the lack of any visible parallax. Tycho had measured the apparent sizes of stars (now known to be illusory), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (much larger than the sun; the size of Earth's orbit or larger). Regarding this Tycho wrote, \"Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.\"[99] He also cited the Copernican system's \"opposition to the authority of Sacred Scripture in more than one place\" as a reason why one might wish to reject it, and observed that his own geo-heliocentric alternative \"offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture\".[100]\n The Jesuit astronomers in Rome were at first unreceptive to Tycho's system; the most prominent, Clavius, commented that Tycho was \"confusing all of astronomy, because he wants to have Mars lower than the Sun.\"[101] However, after the advent of the telescope showed problems with some geocentric models (by demonstrating that Venus circles the Sun, for example), the Tychonic system and variations on that system became popular among geocentrists, and the Jesuit astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli would continue Tycho's use of physics, stellar astronomy (now with a telescope), and religion to argue against heliocentrism and for Tycho's system well into the seventeenth century.\n Giordano Bruno (d. 1600) is the only known person to defend Copernicus's heliocentrism in his time.[102] Using measurements made at Tycho's observatory, Johannes Kepler developed his laws of planetary motion between 1609 and 1619.[103] In Astronomia nova (1609), Kepler made a diagram of the movement of Mars in relation to Earth if Earth were at the center of its orbit, which shows that Mars' orbit would be completely imperfect and never follow along the same path. To solve the apparent derivation of Mars' orbit from a perfect circle, Kepler derived both a mathematical definition and, independently, a matching ellipse around the Sun to explain the motion of the red planet.[104]\n Between 1617 and 1621, Kepler developed a heliocentric model of the Solar System in Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae, in which all the planets have elliptical orbits. This provided significantly increased accuracy in predicting the position of the planets. Kepler's ideas were not immediately accepted, and Galileo for example ignored them. In 1621, Epitome astronomia Copernicanae was placed on the Catholic Church's index of prohibited books despite Kepler being a Protestant.\n Galileo was able to look at the night sky with the newly invented telescope. He published his discoveries that Jupiter is orbited by moons and that the Sun rotates in his Sidereus Nuncius (1610)[105] and Letters on Sunspots (1613), respectively. Around this time, he also announced that Venus exhibits a full range of phases (satisfying an argument that had been made against Copernicus).[105] As the Jesuit astronomers confirmed Galileo's observations, the Jesuits moved away from the Ptolemaic model and toward Tycho's teachings.[106]\n In his 1615 \"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina\", Galileo defended heliocentrism, and claimed it was not contrary to Holy Scripture. He took Augustine's position on Scripture: not to take every passage literally when the scripture in question is in a Bible book of poetry and songs, not a book of instructions or history. The writers of the Scripture wrote from the perspective of the terrestrial world, and from that vantage point the Sun does rise and set. In fact, it is the Earth's rotation which gives the impression of the Sun in motion across the sky.\nIn February 1615, prominent Dominicans including Thomaso Caccini and Niccol\u00f2 Lorini brought Galileo's writings on heliocentrism to the attention of the Inquisition, because they appeared to violate Holy Scripture and the decrees of the Council of Trent.[107][108][109][110] Cardinal and Inquisitor Robert Bellarmine was called upon to adjudicate, and wrote in April that treating heliocentrism as a real phenomenon would be \"a very dangerous thing,\" irritating philosophers and theologians, and harming \"the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false.\"[111]\n In January 1616, Msgr. Francesco Ingoli addressed an essay to Galileo disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the ban against Copernicanism that followed in February.[112] According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the \"chief direct basis\" for the ban.[113] The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned the problem that heliocentrism requires the stars to be much larger than the Sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory \"clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself.\"[114] Ingoli included four theological arguments in the essay, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624.[115]\n In February 1616, the Inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as \"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.\" The Inquisition also determined that the Earth's motion \"receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith.\"[116][117] Bellarmine personally ordered Galileo\n to abstain completely from teaching or defending this doctrine and opinion or from discussing it... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing. In March 1616, after the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, the papal Master of the Sacred Palace, Congregation of the Index, and the Pope banned all books and letters advocating the Copernican system, which they called \"the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to Holy Scripture.\"[118][119] In 1618, the Holy Office recommended that a modified version of Copernicus' De Revolutionibus be allowed for use in calendric calculations, though the original publication remained forbidden until 1758.[119]\n Pope Urban VIII encouraged Galileo to publish the pros and cons of heliocentrism. Galileo's response, Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems (1632), clearly advocated heliocentrism, despite his declaration in the preface that,\n I will endeavour to show that all experiments that can be made upon the Earth are insufficient means to conclude for its mobility but are indifferently applicable to the Earth, movable or immovable...[120]\n and his straightforward statement,\n I might very rationally put it in dispute, whether there be any such centre in nature, or no; being that neither you nor any one else hath ever proved, whether the World be finite and figurate, or else infinite and interminate; yet nevertheless granting you, for the present, that it is finite, and of a terminate Spherical Figure, and that thereupon it hath its centre...[120]\n Some ecclesiastics also interpreted the book as characterizing the Pope as a simpleton, since his viewpoint in the dialogue was advocated by the character Simplicio. Urban VIII became hostile to Galileo and he was again summoned to Rome.[121] Galileo's trial in 1633 involved making fine distinctions between \"teaching\" and \"holding and defending as true\". For advancing heliocentric theory Galileo was forced to recant Copernicanism and was put under house arrest for the last few years of his life. According to J. L. Heilbron, informed contemporaries of Galileo's \"appreciated that the reference to heresy in connection with Galileo or Copernicus had no general or theological significance.\"[122]\n In 1664, Pope Alexander VII published his Index Librorum Prohibitorum Alexandri VII Pontificis Maximi jussu editus (Index of Prohibited Books, published by order of Alexander VII, P.M.) which included all previous condemnations of heliocentric books.[123]\n Ren\u00e9 Descartes' first cosmological treatise, written between 1629 and 1633 and titled The World, included a heliocentric model, but Descartes abandoned it in the light of Galileo's treatment.[124] In his Principles of Philosophy (1644), Descartes introduced a mechanical model in which planets do not move relative to their immediate atmosphere, but are constituted around space-matter vortices in curved space; these rotate due to centrifugal force and the resulting centripetal pressure.[125] The Galileo affair did little overall to slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe, as Kepler's Epitome of Copernican Astronomy became increasingly influential in the coming decades.[126] By 1686, the model was well enough established that the general public was reading about it in Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds, published in France by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and translated into English and other languages in the coming years. It has been called \"one of the first great popularizations of science.\"[124]\n In 1687, Isaac Newton published Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which provided an explanation for Kepler's laws in terms of universal gravitation and what came to be known as Newton's laws of motion. This placed heliocentrism on a firm theoretical foundation, although Newton's heliocentrism was of a somewhat modern kind. Already in the mid-1680s he recognized the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the center of gravity of the Solar System.[127] For Newton it was not precisely the center of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World\", and this center of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\". Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the center, wherever it was, was at rest.[128]\n Meanwhile, the Catholic Church remained opposed to heliocentrism as a literal description, but this did not by any means imply opposition to all astronomy; indeed, it needed observational data to maintain its calendar. In support of this effort it allowed the cathedrals themselves to be used as solar observatories called meridiane; i.e., they were turned into \"reverse sundials\", or gigantic pinhole cameras, where the Sun's image was projected from a hole in a window in the cathedral's lantern onto a meridian line.[129]\n In the mid-18th century the Church's opposition began to fade. An annotated copy of Newton's Principia was published in 1742 by Fathers le Seur and Jacquier of the Franciscan Minims, two Catholic mathematicians, with a preface stating that the author's work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without the theory. In 1758 the Catholic Church dropped the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism from the Index of Forbidden Books.[130] The Observatory of the Roman College was established by Pope Clement XIV in 1774 (nationalized in 1878, but re-founded by Pope Leo XIII as the Vatican Observatory in 1891). In spite of dropping its active resistance to heliocentrism, the Catholic Church did not lift the prohibition of uncensored versions of Copernicus's De Revolutionibus or Galileo's Dialogue. The affair was revived in 1820, when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Catholic Church's chief censor), Filippo Anfossi, refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a physical fact.[131] Settele appealed to pope Pius VII. After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi's decision was overturned.[132] Pius VII approved a decree in 1822 by the Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition to allow the printing of heliocentric books in Rome. Copernicus's De Revolutionibus and Galileo's Dialogue were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the Index when it appeared in 1835.\n Three apparent proofs of the heliocentric hypothesis were provided in 1727 by James Bradley, in 1838 by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, and in 1851 by L\u00e9on Foucault. Bradley discovered the stellar aberration, proving the relative motion of the Earth. Bessel proved that the parallax of a star was greater than zero by measuring the parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of a star named 61 Cygni. In the same year Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Thomas Henderson measured the parallaxes of other stars, Vega and Alpha Centauri. Experiments like those of Foucault were performed by V. Viviani in 1661 in Florence and by Bartolini in 1833 in Rimini.[133]\n Already in the Talmud, Greek philosophy and science under the general name \"Greek wisdom\" were considered dangerous. They were put under ban then and later for some periods.\nThe first Jewish scholar to describe the Copernican system, albeit without mentioning Copernicus by name, was Maharal of Prague, in his book \"Be'er ha-Golah\" (1593). Maharal makes an argument of radical skepticism, arguing that no scientific theory can be reliable, which he illustrates by the new-fangled theory of heliocentrism upsetting even the most fundamental views on the cosmos.[134]\n Copernicus is mentioned in the books of David Gans (1541\u20131613), who worked with Brahe and Kepler. Gans wrote two books on astronomy in Hebrew: a short one, \"Magen David\" (1612), and a full one, \"Nehmad veNaim\" (published only in 1743). He described objectively three systems: those of Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe, without taking sides.\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591\u20131655) in his \"Elim\" (1629) says that the arguments of Copernicus are so strong, that only an imbecile will not accept them.[135] Delmedigo studied at Padua and was acquainted with Galileo.[136]\n An actual controversy on the Copernican model within Judaism arises only in the early 18th century. Most authors in this period had accepted Copernican heliocentrism, with opposition from David Nieto and Tobias Cohn, who argued against heliocentrism on the grounds it contradicted scripture. Nieto merely rejected the new system on those grounds without much passion, whereas Cohn went so far as to call Copernicus \"a first-born of Satan\", though he also acknowledged that he would have found it difficult to proffer one particular objection based on a passage from the Talmud.[137]\n In the 19th century, two students of the Hatam sofer wrote books that were given approbations by him even though one supported heliocentrism and the other geocentrism. One, a commentary on Genesis titled Yafe\u2019ah le-Ketz[138] written by R. Israel David Schlesinger resisted a heliocentric model and supported geocentrism.[139] The other, Mei Menuchot[140] written by R. Eliezer Lipmann Neusatz encouraged acceptance of the heliocentric model and other modern scientific thinking.[141]\n Since the 20th century most Jews have not questioned the science of heliocentrism. Exceptions include Shlomo Benizri[142] and R. M.M. Schneerson of Chabad who argued that the question of heliocentrism vs. geocentrism is obsolete because of the relativity of motion.[143] Schneerson's followers in Chabad continue to deny the heliocentric model.[144]\n In 1783, amateur astronomer William Herschel attempted to determine the shape of the universe by examining stars through his handmade telescopes. Herschel was the first to propose a model of the universe based on observation and measurement. [145] At that time, the dominant assumption in cosmology was that the Milky Way was the entire universe, an assumption that has since been proven wrong with observations.[146] Herschel concluded that it was in the shape of a disk, but assumed that the Sun was in the center of the disk, making the model heliocentric.[147][148][149][150]\n Seeing that the stars belonging to the Milky Way appeared to encircle the Earth, Herschel carefully counted stars of given apparent magnitudes, and after finding the numbers were the same in all directions, concluded Earth must be close to the center of the Milky Way. However, there were two flaws in Herschel's methodology: magnitude is not a reliable index to the distance of stars, and some of the areas that he mistook for empty space were actually dark, obscuring nebulae that blocked his view toward the center of the Milky Way.[151]\n The Herschel model remained relatively unchallenged for the next hundred years, with minor refinements. Jacobus Kapteyn introduced motion, density, and luminosity to Herschel's star counts, which still implied a near-central location of the Sun.[147]\n Already in the early 19th century, Thomas Wright and Immanuel Kant speculated that fuzzy patches of light called nebulae were actually distant \"island universes\" consisting of many stellar systems.[152] The shape of the Milky Way galaxy was expected to resemble such \"islands universes.\" \n However, \"scientific arguments were marshalled against such a possibility,\" and this view was rejected by almost all scientists until the early 20th century, with Harlow Shapley's work on globular clusters and Edwin Hubble's measurements in 1924. After Shapley and Hubble showed that the Sun is not the center of the universe, cosmology moved on from heliocentrism to galactocentrism, which states that the Milky Way is the center of the universe.[153]\n Hubble's observations of redshift in light from distant galaxies indicated that the universe was expanding and acentric.[148] As a result, soon after galactocentrism was formulated, it was abandoned in favor of the Big Bang model of the acentric expanding universe. Further assumptions, such as the Copernican principle, the cosmological principle, dark energy, and dark matter, eventually lead to the current model of cosmology, Lambda-CDM.\n The concept of an absolute velocity, including being \"at rest\" as a particular case, is ruled out by the principle of relativity, also eliminating any obvious \"center\" of the universe as a natural origin of coordinates. Even if the discussion is limited to the Solar System, the Sun is not at the geometric center of any planet's orbit, but rather approximately at one focus of the elliptical orbit. Furthermore, to the extent that a planet's mass cannot be neglected in comparison to the Sun's mass, the center of gravity of the Solar System is displaced slightly away from the center of the Sun.[128] (The masses of the planets, mostly Jupiter, amount to 0.14% of that of the Sun.) Therefore, a hypothetical astronomer on an extrasolar planet would observe a small \"wobble\" in the Sun's motion.[citation needed]\n In modern calculations, the terms \"geocentric\" and \"heliocentric\" are often used to refer to reference frames.[154] In such systems the origin in the center of mass of the Earth, of the Earth\u2013Moon system, of the Sun, of the Sun plus the major planets, or of the entire Solar System, can be selected.[155] Right ascension and declination are examples of geocentric coordinates, used in Earth-based observations, while the heliocentric latitude and longitude are used for orbital calculations. This leads to such terms as \"heliocentric velocity\" and \"heliocentric angular momentum\". In this heliocentric picture, any planet of the Solar System can be used as a source of mechanical energy because it moves relatively to the Sun. A smaller body (either artificial or natural) may gain heliocentric velocity due to gravity assist\u00a0\u2013 this effect can change the body's mechanical energy in heliocentric reference frame (although it will not changed in the planetary one). However, such selection of \"geocentric\" or \"heliocentric\" frames is merely a matter of computation. It does not have philosophical implications and does not constitute a distinct physical or scientific model. From the point of view of general relativity, inertial reference frames do not exist at all, and any practical reference frame is only an approximation to the actual space-time, which can have higher or lower precision. Some forms of Mach's principle consider the frame at rest with respect to the distant masses in the universe to have special properties.[citation needed]\n All Islamic astronomers from Thabit ibn Qurra in the ninth century to Ibn al-Shatir in the fourteenth, and all natural philosophers from al-Kindi to Averroes and later, are known to have accepted ... the Greek picture of the world as consisting of two spheres of which one, the celestial sphere ... concentrically envelops the other. \n"

        "the first person OR the elliptical orbits",
        "In astrodynamics or celestial mechanics, an elliptic orbit or elliptical orbit is a Kepler orbit with an eccentricity of less than 1; this includes the special case of a circular orbit, with eccentricity equal to 0. In a stricter sense, it is a Kepler orbit with the eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 (thus excluding the circular orbit). In a wider sense, it is a Kepler orbit with negative energy. This includes the radial elliptic orbit, with eccentricity equal to 1.\n In a gravitational two-body problem with negative energy, both bodies follow similar elliptic orbits with the same orbital period around their common barycenter. Also the relative position of one body with respect to the other follows an elliptic orbit.\n Examples of elliptic orbits include: Hohmann transfer orbit, Molniya orbit, and tundra orbit.\n Under standard assumptions, no other forces acting except two spherically symmetrical bodies m1 and m2,[1] the orbital speed (\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v\\,}\n\n) of one body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed from the vis-viva equation as:[2]\n where:\n The velocity equation for a hyperbolic trajectory has either + \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {1 \\over {a}}}\n\n, or it is the same with the convention that in that case a is negative.\n Under standard assumptions the orbital period(\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T\\,\\!}\n\n) of a body travelling along an elliptic orbit can be computed as:[3]\n where:\n Conclusions:\n Under standard assumptions, the specific orbital energy (\n\n\n\n\u03f5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\epsilon }\n\n) of an elliptic orbit is negative and the orbital energy conservation equation (the Vis-viva equation) for this orbit can take the form:[4]\n where:\n Conclusions:\n Using the virial theorem we find:\n It can be helpful to know the energy in terms of the semi major axis (and the involved masses). The total energy of the orbit is given by\n where a is the semi major axis.\n Since gravity is a central force, the angular momentum is constant:\n At the closest and furthest approaches, the angular momentum is perpendicular to the distance from the mass orbited, therefore:\n The total energy of the orbit is given by[5]\n We may substitute for v and obtain\n This is true for r being the closest / furthest distance so we get two simultaneous equations which we solve for E:\n Since \n\n\n\n\nr\n\n1\n\n\n=\na\n+\na\n\u03f5\n\n\n{\\textstyle r_{1}=a+a\\epsilon }\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n=\na\n\u2212\na\n\u03f5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{2}=a-a\\epsilon }\n\n, where epsilon is the eccentricity of the orbit, we finally have the stated result.\n The flight path angle is the angle between the orbiting body's velocity vector (= the vector tangent to the instantaneous orbit) and the local horizontal. Under standard assumptions of the conservation of angular momentum the flight path angle \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n satisfies the equation:[6]\n where:\n \n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\psi }\n\n is the angle between the orbital velocity vector and the semi-major axis. \n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\nu }\n\n is the local true anomaly. \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n=\n\u03bd\n+\n\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03c8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi =\\nu +{\\frac {\\pi }{2}}-\\psi }\n\n, therefore,\n where \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n is the eccentricity.\n \nThe angular momentum is related to the vector cross product of position and velocity, which is proportional to the sine of the angle between these two vectors. Here \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n is defined as the angle which differs by 90 degrees from this, so the cosine appears in place of the sine. An orbit equation defines the path of an orbiting body \n\n\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m_{2}\\,\\!}\n\n around central body \n\n\n\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m_{1}\\,\\!}\n\n relative to \n\n\n\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m_{1}\\,\\!}\n\n, without specifying position as a function of time.  If the eccentricity is less than 1 then the equation of motion describes an elliptical orbit.  Because Kepler's equation \n\n\n\nM\n=\nE\n\u2212\ne\nsin\n\u2061\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M=E-e\\sin E}\n\n has no general closed-form solution for the Eccentric anomaly (E) in terms of the Mean anomaly (M), equations of motion as a function of time also have no closed-form solution (although numerical solutions exist for both).\n However, closed-form time-independent path equations of an elliptic orbit with respect to a central body can be determined from just an initial position (\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r} }\n\n) and velocity (\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} }\n\n).\n \nFor this case it is convenient to use the following assumptions which differ somewhat from the standard assumptions above:\n The fourth assumption can be made without loss of generality because any three points (or vectors) must lie within a common plane.   Under these assumptions the second focus (sometimes called the \"empty\" focus) must also lie within the XY-plane: \n\n\n\n\nF\n2\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\nf\n\nx\n\n\n,\n\nf\n\ny\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F2} =\\left(f_{x},f_{y}\\right)}\n\n .\n The general equation of an ellipse under these assumptions using vectors is:\n where:\n \nThe semi-major axis length (a) can be calculated as:\n where \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\u00a0\n=\nG\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu \\ =Gm_{1}}\n\n is the standard gravitational parameter.\n \nThe empty focus (\n\n\n\n\nF\n2\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\nf\n\nx\n\n\n,\n\nf\n\ny\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F2} =\\left(f_{x},f_{y}\\right)}\n\n) can be found by first determining the Eccentricity vector:\n Where \n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {h} }\n\n is the specific angular momentum of the orbiting body:[7]\n Then\n This can be done in cartesian coordinates using the following procedure:\n The general equation of an ellipse under the assumptions above is:\n Given:\n and\n Then:\n \n \nFinally, the empty focus coordinates\n \nNow the result values fx, fy and a can be applied to the general ellipse equation above.\n The state of an orbiting body at any given time is defined by the orbiting body's position and velocity with respect to the central body, which can be represented by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (position of the orbiting body represented by x, y, and z) and the similar Cartesian components of the orbiting body's velocity. This set of six variables, together with time, are called the orbital state vectors. Given the masses of the two bodies they determine the full orbit. The two most general cases with these 6 degrees of freedom are the elliptic and the hyperbolic orbit. Special cases with fewer degrees of freedom are the circular and parabolic orbit.\n Because at least six variables are absolutely required to completely represent an elliptic orbit with this set of parameters, then six variables are required to represent an orbit with any set of parameters. Another set of six parameters that are commonly used are the orbital elements.\n In the Solar System, planets, asteroids, most comets and some pieces of space debris have approximately elliptical orbits around the Sun.  Strictly speaking, both bodies revolve around the same focus of the ellipse, the one closer to the more massive body, but when one body is significantly more massive, such as the sun in relation to the earth, the focus may be contained within the larger massing body, and thus the smaller is said to revolve around it. The following chart of the perihelion and aphelion of the planets, dwarf planets and Halley's Comet demonstrates the variation of the eccentricity of their elliptical orbits. For similar distances from the sun, wider bars denote greater eccentricity. Note the almost-zero eccentricity of Earth and Venus compared to the enormous eccentricity of Halley's Comet and Eris.\n Distances of selected bodies of the Solar System from the Sun. The left and right edges of each bar correspond to the perihelion and aphelion of the body, respectively, hence long bars denote high orbital eccentricity. The radius of the Sun is 0.7 million km, and the radius of Jupiter (the largest planet) is 0.07 million km, both too small to resolve on this image.\n A radial trajectory can be a double line segment, which is a degenerate ellipse with semi-minor axis = 0 and eccentricity = 1. Although the eccentricity is 1, this is not a parabolic orbit. Most properties and formulas of elliptic orbits apply. However, the orbit cannot be closed. It is an open orbit corresponding to the part of the degenerate ellipse from the moment the bodies touch each other and move away from each other until they touch each other again. In the case of point masses one full orbit is possible, starting and ending with a singularity. The velocities at the start and end are infinite in opposite directions and the potential energy is equal to minus infinity.\n The radial elliptic trajectory is the solution of a two-body problem with at some instant zero speed, as in the case of dropping an object (neglecting air resistance).\n The Babylonians were the first to realize that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic was not uniform, though they were unaware of why this was; it is today known that this is due to the Earth moving in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with the Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.[8]\n In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun at one focus, and described this in his first law of planetary motion. Later, Isaac Newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation.\n"

        "Testing positive for HIV often leaves a person overwhelmed with questions and concerns. It is important to remember that HIV can be treated effectively with HIV medicines. Treatment with HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) is recommended for everyone with HIV. HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives and reduce the risk of HIV transmission. The first step after testing positive for HIV is to see a health care provider, even if you do not feel sick. Prompt medical care and treatment with HIV medicines as soon as possible is the best way to stay healthy. After testing positive for HIV, a person\u2019s first visit with a health care provider includes a review of the person\u2019s health and medical history, a physical exam, and several lab tests. The health care provider also explains the benefits of HIV treatment and discusses ways to reduce the risk of passing HIV to others. The information collected during a person\u2019s initial visit is used to make decisions about HIV treatment. A health care provider reviews a person\u2019s lab test results to: The following lab tests are used to make decisions about HIV treatment. CD4 count A CD4 count measures the number of CD4 cells in a sample of blood. CD4 cells are infection-fighting cells of the immune system. As HIV advances, a person\u2019s CD4 count drops, which indicates increasing damage to the immune system. Treatment with HIV medicines prevents HIV from destroying CD4 cells. Viral load A viral load test measures how much virus is in the blood (HIV viral load). As HIV progresses to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a person\u2019s viral load increases. HIV medicines prevent HIV from multiplying, which reduces a person\u2019s viral load. A goal of HIV treatment is to keep a person\u2019s viral load so low that the virus cannot be detected by a viral load test. This is known as having an undetectable viral load. Once HIV treatment is started, the CD4 count and viral load are used to monitor whether the HIV medicines are controlling a person\u2019s HIV. Drug-resistance testing Health care providers consider many factors when recommending HIV medicines, including a person\u2019s drug-resistance test results. Drug-resistance testing identifies which, if any, HIV medicines will not be effective against a person\u2019s strain of HIV. The HIVinfo infographic What do my lab results mean? has more information about tests used to monitor HIV infection and treatment. People with HIV should start taking HIV medicines as soon as possible after their HIV is diagnosed. However, before starting treatment, people with HIV must be prepared to take HIV medicines every day for the rest of their lives. Issues, such as lack of health insurance or an inability to pay for HIV medicines, can make it hard to take HIV medicines consistently. Health care providers can recommend resources to help people deal with any issues before they start taking HIV medicines. Yes, an initial visit with a health care provider is a good time to ask questions. The following are some questions that people with newly diagnosed HIV typically ask: \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThe following are resources to share with someone with newly diagnosed HIV: From the Department of Health and Human Services: From the Department of Veterans Affairs: Also see the HIV Source collection of HIV links and resources.

        "the first person AND my first step",
        "Buying a home is exciting. It\u2019s also one of the most important financial decisions you\u2019ll make. Choosing a mortgage to pay for your new home is just as important as choosing the right home. You have the right to control the process. Check out our\u00a0other blogs on homebuying topics, and join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter using #ShopMortgage. Research\u00a0shows that people who plan carefully for big purchases, like owning a home, are less likely to run into financial trouble later. So if you are thinking about buying a home this year, let\u2019s make a plan. The first step: Check your credit.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a good idea to review your credit reports and scores periodically, even if you\u2019re years away from shopping for a home and a mortgage.\u00a0If you\u2019re planning to buy a home this year, we recommend checking your credit reports and scores as soon as possible.\u00a0 The better your credit history, the more likely you are to receive a good interest rate on your mortgage loan. Lenders will use your credit reports and scores as important factors in determining whether you qualify for a loan, and what interest rate to offer you. \u00a0If there are errors on your credit report, you may have trouble qualifying for a loan. \u00a0So, don\u2019t delay in checking your credit. \u00a0Review your credit reports and take steps to fix any errors. It\u2019s the first step to building a strong financial foundation for your new home. Keep reading to:  Sign up for our 2-week Get Homebuyer Ready boot camp. We\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the entire homebuying process. Privacy Act statement\u00a0 A credit report contains information about your credit such as the status of your credit accounts and your payment history. Lenders use these reports to help them decide if they will loan you money, and at what interest rate.\u00a0Credit reporting agencies (also known as credit reporting companies or credit bureaus) compile these reports.\u00a0Credit scores are calculated using a mathematical formula\u2014called a scoring model\u2014that companies and lenders use to predict how likely you are to pay back a loan on time. Your credit scores are calculated from the information in your credit report.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to getting, reviewing, and understanding your credit reports. There are three major credit reporting companies \u2013\u00a0Equifax ,\u00a0Experian , and\u00a0TransUnion . Each company maintains a separate report. You have the right to a free copy of your credit report once per year from each of the three companies at\u00a0www.annualcreditreport.com . You can also call 1-877-322-8228.\u00a0 If you review your credit report from one of the major companies every four months, you can get a good idea of your credit throughout the year at no cost. However, if you are planning to start the homebuying process within the next six months to a year, you may want to request and review all of them at once to check for errors or issues.\u00a0Checking your credit report will not hurt your credit score. Your free credit report does not include your credit scores \u2013 keep reading to learn how to check your scores.\u00a0 Once you get your credit report, you will want to review it carefully. Ordering it is not enough \u2014 you have to read it. Credit reports may have mistakes. And if there are mistakes, you are the one who is most likely to find them. Incorrect information can appear on your report because the credit bureaus processed the information incorrectly or because lenders or debt collectors sent flawed information to the credit bureaus or did not update the information they previously reported. Incorrect information may also be a result of fraud, such as when someone uses your identity to open accounts or takes on debt without your knowledge. You should review your credit report for any errors or fraudulent activity. \u00a0 When you review your credit report, look for:   Review each account listed on your credit report. \u00a0If you see any of this information, highlight it:   Check the credit inquiries section of your credit report:  Check the \u201cnegative information\u201d section:\u00a0   With each credit report you get, use this checklist to help you review and check for errors.\u00a0 You can use our printable\u00a0\u201cCredit Report Review Checklist\u201d \u00a0to help you review each section of your credit report.\u00a0We recommend using this worksheet for each credit report you get throughout the year. Then, keep the completed checklist with your credit reports. \u00a0\u00a0 If you find errors or fraudulent activity after your review of your credit report, you have the right to\u00a0dispute inaccurate or incomplete information. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a difference between inaccurate or incomplete information and negative but accurate and complete information. Both can lower your credit score, but a credit reporting company will only correct information that is inaccurate or, incomplete, or outdated. \u00a0 To dispute an error, you should contact both the credit reporting company and the company that provided your information to the credit reporting company. For example, if you review your report and find a listing for a student loan you never took out, you should contact both the credit reporting company that provided the report and the student loan company listed. Be sure to include supporting documentation with your disputes to both companies. The companies must conduct an investigation and fix mistakes as needed.\u00a0 The three major credit reporting companies provide instructions for filing a dispute online:\u00a0Equifax ,\u00a0Experian , and\u00a0TransUnion . You can also submit a dispute by phone or paper mail. The CFPB provides a\u00a0sample dispute letter\u00a0that you can use if you want to submit your dispute by mail.\u00a0 No matter how you submit your dispute, make sure to include:\u00a0   Get more tips and contact information to\u00a0dispute an error on your credit report. Beware of any service that says it can dispute inaccuracies for a fee. You have a legal right to dispute inaccuracies yourself, at no cost. If you find an error on one of your credit reports, check your credit reports from all three reporting agencies. Lenders operate differently from one another, so while one may pull your Experian report, another might pull your TransUnion or Equifax report. It\u2019s important to make sure they\u2019re all accurate.\u00a0 If you find outdated negative information on your credit report, contact the credit reporting company and ask that it be removed. Bankruptcies are considered outdated if they are more than 10 years old. Most other negative information is considered outdated if it is more than 7 years old. A credit score is a number based on information contained in your credit report. You don\u2019t have just one credit score. There are many credit scoring formulas, and the score will also depend on the data used to calculate it.\u00a0 Different lenders may use different scoring formulas, so your score can vary depending on what type of score the lender uses (a mortgage score or an auto score, for example). Today, most mortgage lenders use a\u00a0FICO score\u00a0when deciding whether to offer you a loan, and in setting the rate and terms. Your FICO score will differ depending on the credit bureau and FICO scoring model your lender uses \u2013 so you have an Experian FICO score, an Equifax FICO score, and a TransUnion FICO score. Also, be aware that your score changes as the information in your credit report changes. Different scoring formulas may come up with somewhat different numbers for your credit score, but they are all based on the same key information:   Most FICO scores range from 300-850. A higher score makes it easier to qualify for a loan and may result in a better interest rate. As of March 2015, the median FICO score nationwide was 721. The best rates go to borrowers with credit scores in the mid-700s or above. For more tips on how to get and keep good credit, visit\u00a0Ask CFPB. When you request your own credit report, those requests will not hurt your score. There are several ways to get a credit score, some of which are free. When choosing how to get a score, pay attention to the fine print about how the score is calculated. Some companies that offer credit scores use different scoring models than lenders use. Here are 4 ways to get a score:  Borrowers\u00a0with credit scores in the mid-600s range and below generally pay the highest rates and have the fewest choices. Borrowers in this range may have trouble qualifying for a loan, depending on the loan type and the specific lenders. If your score is in this range, you may want to meet with a\u00a0housing counselor\u00a0and\u00a0explore your loan options\u00a0to decide whether you want to go ahead now or work to improve your credit before applying for a mortgage. \u00a0 In 2013, only four percent of homebuyers taking out a mortgage had scores less than 620. The loans available to borrowers with credit scores less than 620 often have very high interest rates and risky features. If your score is in this range, you may want to improve your credit before applying for a mortgage. A non-profit\u00a0credit counselor\u00a0or HUD-approved\u00a0housing counseling agency\u00a0can help you make a plan to improve your credit. If you are looking to improve your credit, beware of anyone who claims that they can remove negative information that\u2019s current and accurate from your credit report. This could be a\u00a0credit repair scam. You can\u2019t get negative information removed from your credit reports if the information is current and accurate, but you can take steps to rebuild your credit. There are no shortcuts to building good credit history; it takes time and making regular, on-time payments to your accounts.\u00a0Learn more about getting and keeping a good credit score.\u00a0  If you are in the market to buy a home, lenders will\u00a0use your credit scores\u00a0to decide whether they\u2019re willing to lend to you and at what interest rate. \u00a0 Don\u2019t apply for any more credit than you absolutely need.\u00a0If you can, avoid applying for new accounts or adding significantly to your debt. Your credit score may decline if you have too many new account requests or too much new debt. However, when you request your own credit report, those requests will not hurt your score. And when you shop for a mortgage with multiple lenders, the additional credit checks\u00a0won\u2019t hurt your credit\u00a0so long as they happen within a short window of time, roughly 45 days. \u00a0 Remember that everyone, regardless of credit score, has the right to shop around for the best mortgage for their financial situation. Checking your credit history, fixing any errors, and knowing your credit scores will put you in the best possible shape for getting a mortgage. \u00a0 We\u2019ve got a lot of information on our site already to help you get started.\u00a0  \n            \n\n            Join the conversation.

In both years, we undertook three-month surveys of Aedes populations in or near the capital city Ouagadougou, where the outbreaks were centered. In 1200LG (urban), Tabtenga (peri-urban) and Goundry (rural) localities, we collected indoor and outdoor resting mosquito adults, characterized larval habitats and containers producing pupae and reared immature stages to adulthood in the laboratory for identification. All mosquito adults were identified morphologically. Host species (from which bloodmeals were taken) were identified by PCR. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate relationships between adult or larval densities and multiple explanatory variables. From samples in 1,780 houses, adult Ae. aegypti were significantly more abundant in the two urban localities (Tabtenga and 1200 LG) in both years than in the rural site (Goundry), where Anopheles spp. were far more common. Results from adult collections indicated a highly exophilic and anthropophilic (>90% bloodmeals of human origin) vector population, but with a relatively high proportion of bloodfed females caught inside houses. Habitats producing most pupae were waste tires (37% of total pupae), animal troughs (44%) and large water barrels (30%). While Stegomyia indices were not reliable indicators of adult mosquito abundance, shared influences on adult and immature stage densities included rainfall and container water level, collection month and container type/purpose. Spatial analysis showed autocorrelation of densities, with a partial overlap in adult and immature stage hotspots. Results provide an evidence base for the selection of appropriate vector control methods to minimize the risk, frequency and magnitude of future outbreaks in Ouagadougou. An integrated strategy combining community-driven practices, waste disposal and insecticide-based interventions is proposed. The prospects for developing a regional approach to arbovirus control in West Africa or across Africa are discussed. Aedes aegypti is the most efficient vector of human diseases including yellow fever, dengue chikungunya and Zika. West Africa is an emerging hotspot for dengue, as illustrated by Burkina Faso\u2019s outbreaks in 2016 and 2017. Coincidentally, this study investigated the bionomics and behavior of Ae. aegypti in urban, peri-urban and rural localities of Ouagadougou, from August to October in 2016 and 2017. The results from over 1700 homes showed that Ae. aegypti preferentially fed on humans and rested primarily outdoors. The most common pupal productive habitats were discarded vehicle tires, animal water troughs and large water barrels. Infestation rates were higher in the urban and peri-urban localities. A range of community-based control measures are suitable for consideration in a vector control program to prevent outbreaks. This study provides the most complete contemporary description of an Ae. aegypti population in West Africa, providing evidence for mosquito control programs to prevent or mitigate disease outbreaks. The potential of a regional vector control program for west Africa is discussed briefly. Citation: Badolo A, Sombi\u00e9 A, Yam\u00e9ogo F, Wangrawa DW, Sanon A, Pignatelli PM, et al.

Aedes aegypti mosquitoes thrive in urban environments throughout the tropics and sub-tropics, where they are the primary human vectors of dengue, Zika, chikungunya and urban yellow fever arboviruses. Dengue is the most widespread with an estimated annual toll of 400 million infections, and a threat to almost half of the human population at risk globally [1,2]. Driven by climate change, further increases are predicted [3] and the search for effective and sustainable methods to control peridomestic Aedes populations has become a primary global health challenge. The worldwide expansion in Aedes aegypti populations in the late twentieth century followed a period when the human population grew at an unprecedented rate, mainly in cities, environments where this vector also could flourish [4,5]. Increases in global trade and human travel, particularly access to affordable and rapid intercontinental air travel, transferred multiple strains of arboviruses far beyond their original ranges into immunologically na\u00efve populations [6], while climate change increased outbreak risk in new areas outside of the tropics [7,8]. With almost 500 million people already living in its cities and a population doubling-rate of 25 years, sub-Saharan Africa has the fastest urbanization growth rate worldwide [9,10]. In many countries, sylvatic cycles of yellow fever frequently initiate outbreaks [11\u201316] that threaten urban areas where human to human transmission by Ae. aegypti would result in frequent outbreaks, were it not for an effective vaccine [17,18]. There have been significant outbreaks of chikungunya in countries of East, South and North Africa [19\u201322] and increasingly, reports of Zika [23,24]. Indeed, better diagnostic methods are revealing that chikungunya infections, though causing little mortality, are responsible for greater morbidity and a higher-disease burden than previously suspected [6]. Dengue presents the greatest arboviral threat to Africa, with West Africa identified as a potential dengue transmission hotspot, based on its rapid rate of unplanned urbanization, widespread occurrence of Aedes vectors, history of arbovirus transmission and poor clinical knowledge of flavivirus infections [25]. The vast majority of recent knowledge of Aedes aegypti was generated by studies in Asia and Latin America [26\u201329], and may not be transferred reliably to African Ae. aegypti populations [30]. The need for continent-specific knowledge is reinforced by growing evidence of the genetic and phenotypic diversity of Ae. aegypti within Africa and differences in the epidemiology of Aedes-borne diseases globally [4,31,32]. Burkina Faso experienced dengue outbreaks in 2016, resulting in 2,600 cases and 21 deaths, and in 2017, resulting in 14,455 cases and 29 deaths [33,34]. The outbreak continued into 2018, with a further 4,386 cases and 25 deaths. Though all four dengue virus serotypes had been recorded previously in Burkina Faso [35], only types I, II and III were reported in the recent outbreak, of which type II was the most prevalent [36]. In August 2016, we began a study on the bionomics of Ae. aegypti in Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso, with the objective of collecting baseline data for dengue control. Though not planned that way, the study coincided with the dengue outbreaks in 2016 and 2017 and sampling was carried out in locations where and while transmission was occurring. Here we report the results of wet season investigations into the behavioral preferences and spatial distribution of Ae. aegypti breeding and adult resting sites across different levels of urbanization, and use this evidence base to develop an appropriate, effective and sustainable vector control strategy for Ouagadougou, suitable for use as a regional template within a larger integrated vector management program. The study protocol received ethical approval from the National Ethical Committee (Comit\u00e9 National d\u2019Ethique pour la Recherche en Sant\u00e9), Ministry of Health, Burkina Faso (Deliberation No. 2016-6-073; 6th June 2016) and from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee for \u201cDengue in Burkina Faso: establishing a vector biology evidence base for risk assessment and vector control strategies for an emerging disease\u201d(Research Protocol 16\u201330; 15th July 2016). Burkina Faso occupies three climatic zones: the Sahelian in the north, the central Soudano-Sahelian zone and Soudanian in the south. The capital city Ouagadougou lies in the Soudano-Sahelian zone, within the 500 mm isohyet where 350\u2013750 mm rain falls between June and October. Three distinct localities in or near the city were selected on the basis of house design and size, house density (peri-urban had higher housing density compared to urban and rural), and land use, as representatives of urban, peri-urban and rural settings. (1200 LG) (12\u00b022\u2019N; 1\u00b029\u2019W) is an urban setting of 1.2 km2 in central Ouagadougou, less than 1 km from the international airport. Roads are paved and the area is connected to centralized water, waste and electricity systems. Houses are relatively modern single- or two-storey and typically comprise one living room and 2\u20133 bedrooms, often with air conditioning. Vegetation, often within gardens, is common on both private and common land. (12\u00b022\u2019N; 1\u00b027\u2019W) is a 10 km2 peri-urban setting located within Ouagadougou, approximately 5 km east of 1200 LG. Roads are unpaved, there are no electricity or waste management systems and the majority of households obtain water at communal pumps. Typical households are single-storey structures with 1\u20134 rooms, within walled compounds. Vegetation is sparse. (12\u00b030\u2019N, 1\u00b020\u2019W) is a small rural farming community village situated 30 km north-east of Ouagadougou, with unpaved roads, low housing density, and is surrounded by fields and trees. There is a dam in the center of the villages enabling people to practice gardening during the dry season. Goundry has no electricity or waste management systems and households obtain water at communal pumps. Livestock, mainly cattle and sheep, and dogs are common. Longitudinal surveys were carried out during the wet season from August to October in both 2016 and 2017. Prior to each survey, all prospective houses were visited to inform the population of the proposed project, and the proposed sampling procedures. Each day, the first house was selected at random and the second and subsequent houses chosen where the family were present and agreed to participate, avoiding the houses nearest to the previous one. An average of ten houses were visited per day. Houses were sampled at 06:00\u201309:00 or 16:00\u201319:00 by two teams of four persons, each working as follows: one person collected written informed consent and household data (S1 Table) from participants, a second person searched for adult mosquitoes indoors and outdoors; two people recorded breeding habitat characteristics and collected immature stages of mosquitoes. Areas of public or communal land adjacent to sampled houses were mapped and inspected for containers, from which mosquito immature stages were processed as described below. At each property, the team worked indoors and outdoors inspecting every container capable of holding sufficient water for immature mosquitoes, recording its dimensions, water volume, water level, material (natural, wood, metal, cement, etc.) and utility (whether the container was in use (yes) or discarded waste (no)). Where possible, water from each container was poured into a graduated beaker and any immature mosquitoes collected using a sieve. The water volume of heavy or immovable containers, including potable water, was measured by removal with buckets, again using a sieve to collect all mosquitoes, before being returning to the container. All larvae and pupae were transferred alive to containers labelled by house number and breeding site location, for subsequent identification. Breeding habitats were categorized using the WHO operational guide [28] with minor adaptations to accommodate certain features observed in Ouagadougou as follows: Stegomyia indices were calculated as defined by Focks[37]: To identify the most productive dengue vector breeding sites, and to determine whether certain habitats that were relatively more productive for pupae might be identified for future targeting, we recorded pupae separately from larvae. Pupal mortality is typically low meaning that the number of pupae is highly correlated with the number of adults [38]. To identify the most productive Ae. aegypti immature stage habitats, the percentage contribution of each container type to the total count of pupae is calculated as the total number of pupae per container type, divided by the total number of pupae in all containers throughout the study area [28]. Using a Prokopack aspirator [39], all adult mosquitoes were collected from each house, animal shelter and external kitchen. Indoors, wall surfaces, closet or cupboard interiors and other known resting places [40], were inspected using flashlights, for a total of 10 minutes per household [41]. Outdoors, all walls, eaves, vegetation (flowers) and shaded areas within or behind containers, stored materials, and car tires within the walled area marking the perimeter of each household were then inspected for an additional 10 minutes. All immature mosquito stages were sorted based on morphology then reared in cups with ground Tetramin as food until adult emergence. Pupae were transferred to fresh cups and emerging adults killed and preserved by freezing for identification. Mosquitoes were identified by microscopy using morphological keys. Aedes aegypti [42\u201344] was identified as described by Moore et al. [45] and all other culicine species were identified using Edwards (1941)[46]. Anopheles species identification followed the keys of Gillies & Coetzee [47] and Diagne et al. [48]. The SINE method [49] was used to identify Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes to species level. DNA was extracted from abdomens of bloodfed females using Qiagen DNEasy kits. Extracted DNA served as template for amplification of the cytochrome b gene using human, cow, pig, dog, goat and sheep species-specific primers in a cocktail PCR [50]. Each reaction contained 15.8 ul of water, 2.5ul of 10x DreamTaq buffer, 0.5 ul 10mM of each dNTP, 0.5ul of 50 \u03bcM of each primer; 0.2 of 5U/ul DreamTaq and 3 ul of DNA for a total volume of 25ul. The PCRs were run with the program 95\u00b0C for 5 min, then 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 60 s, 56\u00b0C for 60 s, 72\u00b0C for 60 s, followed by a final extension step of 72\u00b0C for 7 min. Products were run on a 2% TAE-agarose gel, with band size interpretation as follows: 334 bp (human), 453 bp (pig), 132 bp (goat or sheep), 680 bp (dog), 561 bp (cow). PCR products of positive bloodmeals that gave unclear gel banding-patterns were sequenced using universal vertebrate primers [50], aligned using codon code aligner v 4.7 (Codoncode corp., USA) and their species of origin identified using NCBI BLAST searches. Daily records of minimal, maximal, mean temperatures, relative humidity and daily rainfall were obtained from the National Meteorological Agency records from Ouagadougou station for 2016 and 2017. Intermediate calculations were made for the cumulative rainfall for previous 4 days, one week, 12 days or 14 days to be included in the models. To investigate factors associated with Aedes sp. abundance we developed four Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) with a negative binomial link function using the R package \u201cglmmTMB\u201d [51]. The first (adult model) and second (bloodfed model) were fitted to the number of adults and bloodfed Aedes collected in each house, respectively, as a function of the abiotic and biotic covariates: the year of collection, locality (1200 LG, Tabtenga, Goundry), house type (mixed, modern or traditional), location (indoors/outdoors), number of children, ITNs presence, ITNs number, animal presence, animal number, day of collection, month of collection, the number of immatures collected in breeding sites located in that house, and also climate factors including temperature and cumulative rainfall. The interaction terms \u2018collection location\u2019 and locality, and locality and year were also included, and to account for variation arising from the sampling design we included date of collection and house identifier as random effects. The third (larval model) and fourth (pupal model) models were fitted to the number of larvae and pupae per container, respectively, as a function of the abiotic and biotic covariates: locality, container type, water level, water volume, container material, the \u2018location\u2019 (i.e. indoors/outdoors) of the containers utility, rainfall and temperature, number of adults collected in the house. As in the adult mosquito model, the variables location and locality, and year and locality were also included as interaction terms, and date of collection and house identifier were added as random effects. From these full models we selected the minimal model using a stepwise backward model selection procedure based on the lowest AIC values by removing factors with highest p-value in the model. If removing a variable resulted in a change of the AIC value of more than 2 and the resultant model was still parsimonious. e.g. following residuals diagnostics in DHARMa [52], the simplified model was kept. This procedure was repeated until removing variables no longer improved the model. To ensure the models described above were appropriate, we also explored the use of alternative families such as poisson and quasipoisson, but DHARMa residuals diagnostics indicated that these failed to capture the dispersion in data. We tested for spatial autocorrelation both in the data and residuals of the models using the Moran\u2019s I test [53] and found no significant spatial autocorrelation (for a p-value of 0.05), hence inclusion of a spatial term was not required. Finally, we estimated the correlation among our potential covariates, if two variables were >50% correlated, one of them was excluded from the final full model. These included temperature and relative humidity, immatures total number and larvae number, number of residents and number of children. Since larvae and immatures were correlated (53%), for the adult model we used the covariate \u2018immatures\u2019 (sum of larvae and pupae). To estimate the overlap between the spatial distributions of adult and immature stages, we used the \u201cnicheOverlap\u201d function in the R package \u2018dismo\u2019 [54], which estimates an index of similarity between rasterized density distributions based on [55], and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two distributions using the \u2018layerStats\u2019 function in the package \u2018raster\u2019 [56]. The density maps were built based on the coordinates of each sampling location using the R package leaflet [57] which uses open-source basemaps from OpenStreetMap (CC BY-SA 2.0). To analyse whether the location of blood-feeding (indoor vs outdoors) was in line with collection densities, the expected numbers of indoor blood fed females were predicted from the total bloodfed collections in each year and locality multiplied by the relative indoor density. A chi-square goodness of fit test was used to determine whether observed values deviated from predictions. Other comparisons between proportions used chi-square contingency table tests or Fisher exact tests (depending on the expected values). Stegomyia index results were compared among localities using non-overlapping confidence intervals as indicative of a significant difference. A total of 1,163 houses were sampled in 2016 and 631 in 2017, plus an additional 24 public spaces in 2017 (S1 Table), including among others, places of worship, schools, market stalls and stores. All houses in 1200 LG (urban) were cement block buildings of modern designs, whereas the houses in Tabtenga (peri-urban) and Goundry (rural) were a mix of traditional adobe houses and modern houses. Average occupancy rates in each locality in 2016 were 5.3, 5.0 and 2.9 residents per house, and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) were seen in 75.9%, 91.5% and 75.9% of houses, with an average of 0.44, 0.43 and 0.43 ITNs per person, respectively. In 2017, the average occupancy rates in each locality were 5.2, 6.2 and 3.3, and ITNs were seen in 60.6%, 87.8% and 88.7% respectively, with an average 0.36 ITNs per person in each locality. A total of 47,255 adult mosquitoes were collected during both years in all localities by indoor and outdoor resting catches (Table 1). Aedes aegypti abundance varied between the sampling localities in both years (2016: \u03c722 = 187.1; P<<0.001; 2017: \u03c722 = 165.2; P<<0.001). Adult Ae. aegypti were more abundant in 1200 LG and Tabtenga, where they comprised between 9.3 and 12.8% of the total catch, at house infestation rates of between 63.1 and 77.2%. Collections in Goundry were consistently lower than in the urban and peri-urban sites, comprising less than 5% of the total number of mosquitoes caught, with house infestation rates of less than 20.8%. Low numbers of other Aedes species were collected, mainly in Goundry, and included Aedes vittatus, Aedes hirsutus, and Aedes metallicus (Table 1). Proportions were calculated only for the most common vector species Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus.\n Proportions were calculated only for the most common vector species Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus. \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.t001 Catches of other mosquitoes were dominated by Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae s.l. (Table 1). Culex quinquefasciatus was by far the most abundant mosquito in the two urbanised sites, 1200 LG and Tabtenga, where it comprised approximately 80% of the total collections. In rural Goundry, numbers of Cx. quinquefasciatus were significantly lower, comprising less than 25% of catches (\u03c721 = 191.9, P<<0.001). In contrast, the proportions of An. gambiae s.l. in catches at Goundry were over ten times greater than at the urban and peri-urban localities (56% vs. 4%; \u03c721 = 11.34, P<<0.001). Molecular identification of Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes revealed significant variation in species composition (\u03c724 = 1027, P<<0.001) with the highest proportions of An. coluzzii seen in Goundry, whereas An. arabiensis was the dominant species in Tabtenga and 1200 LG (Table 1). Other Anopheles species (Anopheles rufipes, Anopheles funestus and Anopheles ziemani) and the predatory culicine Lutzia tigripes were recorded much more frequently in Goundry (1.2% vs 0.1%; Table 1). Significantly more adult female Ae. aegypti were collected resting outdoors than indoors in all localities in each year (S2 Table), with a remarkably consistent proportion outdoors each year (mean = 0.73 in both 2016 and 2017), equivalent to an outdoor: indoor ratio of 2.7-fold (binomial test P<0.001). As can be seen in Fig 1 differences in relative proportions caught indoor and outdoor varied among localities (\u03c722 = 149, <0.001), with a consistently lower, but still strongly exophilic-biased, ratio in Tabtenga. Geometric means and 95% confidence limits of numbers of Ae. aegypti adults collected indoors and outdoors per house, in the three localities in 2016 and 2017.\n Geometric means and 95% confidence limits of numbers of Ae. aegypti adults collected indoors and outdoors per house, in the three localities in 2016 and 2017. \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.g001 However, the proportion of bloodfed females caught outdoor was only slightly greater than those indoor (ratio = 1.05), which represents approximately twice the expected number predicted from the total indoor: outdoor catch ratio (Table 2). This suggests that a preference for exophily may not be sustained through the entire gonotrophic cycle. The expected number of bloodfed mosquitoes indoors was calculated from the proportion caught indoors and compared to observed numbers bloodfed using a chi-square goodness of fit test.\n The expected number of bloodfed mosquitoes indoors was calculated from the proportion caught indoors and compared to observed numbers bloodfed using a chi-square goodness of fit test. \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.t002 Trends in morning vs. afternoon collections of Ae. aegypti were inconsistent across years (S3 Table). In 2016, there appeared to be a bias toward morning collections (59.6%; binomial test, P<0.001), but in 2017 morning and afternoon collections were very similar (50.3%; binomial test, P = 0.83). Similarly, strong variation between localities in morning:afternoon collections was evident in 2016, with relatively morning\u2013biased collections in the urban and peri-urban sites but afternoon-biased in Goundry (\u03c722 = 497, P<0.001), but was barely-evident in 2017 (\u03c722 = 6.1, P = 0.047). In total, 158/180 (88%) (S4 Table) of Ae. aegypti mosquito blood meal samples that amplified successfully by PCR were of human origin, with a higher proportion in 2016 (92%) than in 2017 (76%) (\u03c721 = 7.9, P = 0.005). None of the relatively few bloodfed mosquitoes from Goundry amplified successfully in 2017, but there was no significant difference in bloodfeeding rates between sites in 2016 (\u03c722 = 0.2, P = 0.90). Six bloodmeals contained blood from multiple hosts: five had human and canine blood and one contained both canine and bovine blood (S4 Table). Significant factors predicting Ae. aegypti adult abundance are shown in Table 3. Consistent with the analyses presented above, locality (urban, peri-urban, rural) was a strong determinant, as was the collection location (indoors vs. outdoors), with variation in the indoor:outdoor ratio between localities shown by the significant interaction term. Whilst collections in Tabtenga and Goundry were quite consistent between years, the number of Ae. aegypti collected in 1200 LG was much lower in 2017 than 2016 (evident in the significant year and year x locality interaction terms). However, it should be noted that the proportion of Ae. aegypti in the total mosquito catch was similar, and actually slightly higher, in 1200 LG in 2017 as a result of a much lower abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus (Table 1). Collection month and rainfall also exerted significant effects with reduced abundance in October, and a positive relationship with rainfall over the past 14 days. Importantly, adult abundance was also predicted by the abundance of immature stages from containers in or around the same household, with larval and pupal collections pooled due to low pupal numbers. House type was retained in the minimal model, but explained little variation, whilst other factors did not add to predictive value and were excluded from the final model.

In contrast, Aedes vittatus, which comprised less than 0.5% of the immatures collected in the two urban localities, amounted to 40.6% of the total in Goundry (S5 Table). Aedes vittatus immatures were found mainly in water residues in the animal drinking troughs that were more common in Goundry than in the urban sites (S1 Fig). Few immature Anopheles gambiae s.l. were collected in any site, as would be expected for a species that typically breeds in ground water pools rather than the containers sampled in this study. Overall mosquito community composition was strongly influenced by collection location, which was consistent across the two sampling years, with significant difference between rural Goundry and the two urban sites (S1 Fig). Across all three localities, a total of 1,445 containers were inspected during the study of which 666 (46%) contained Aedes aegypti larvae or pupae (Fig 2). Immatures were found in all container types inspected and although infestation rates of container types were significantly different across the localities (\u03c72 = 170; P<<0.001; Fig 2), there were some consistencies. Tires were among the most heavily infested in both urbanised localities, reaching rates of 31% and 32% in Tabtenga and 1200 LG respectively, but they were of minimal importance in Goundry, where infested domestic water storage drums (40%) were the most heavily infested (Fig 2).  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.g002 Not all containers found to contain larvae may support development to the pupal stage and be regarded as productive for breeding. However for pupae, in urban and peri-urban sites, tires were highly productive habitats, containing 37% and 34% of all pupae in 1200 LG and Tabtenga respectively (Table 4 and Fig 2).  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.t004 Other highly productive containers included large water storage containers (drums, jars or barrels) from which, in Tabtenga, an area without piped water, 40% of pupae were found. In contrast, these large containers produced only 13% of pupae in 1200 LG, an area with piped water, and where instead, small containers including miscellaneous objects (plastic and metallic boxes, terracotta pots, plastic shoes,..) were responsible for nearly 40% of the vector population. Large water drums or barrels were also important in the semi-rural locality Goundry (30%), where the most productive habitats were animal water troughs (44%). A generalised linear model fitted to the number of Aedes aegypti larvae collected per breeding site showed an effect of year (2017 collections > 2016 collections) and significant differences between localities, which were consistent across years, with both the urban and peri-urban localities having much higher densities than the rural site, Goundry (S6 Table). Container type influenced larval density with highest larval densities found in tires. Higher water levels in containers were also associated with higher larval density and highest larval densities occurred in September compared to August and October. Factors such as cumulative rainfall totals measured over 2 or 7 days, temperature, container purpose, number of residents, and numbers of adult mosquitoes collected had no significant associations with larval density. Pupal density did not differ significantly between years, and was higher only in Tabtenga than Goundry, with urban 1200 LG not significantly different (S7 Table). Container type influenced pupal density, but in contrast to larvae, tires were not significantly more productive, with only animal drinking troughs significantly higher than the reference category. Container utility was important as pupal density was reduced by 43% in functional containers compared with non-functional/discarded containers Pupal density was also negatively associated with mean temperature and was also positively associated with the number of adult mosquitoes collected in the same house. The Stegomyia indices are summarized in Fig 3, and show that the WHO thresholds were exceeded for all stegomyia indices in Goundry. In the peri-urban locality of Tabtenga, the container and pupal indices exceeded the WHO thresholds, but the Breteau and House Indices, were less informative in 2017. The red line indicates the WHO thresholds that are set at 50, 20 and 35 respectively for BI, CI and HI. The PPI threshold is estimated based on an initial seroprevalence of 33% and an average temperature of 28\u00b0C and for an increase of 10% of the seroprevalence [37].\n The red line indicates the WHO thresholds that are set at 50, 20 and 35 respectively for BI, CI and HI.

Niche overlap analysis showed that approaching half of the distribution of adults and immatures overlapped (index = 0.44). Whilst this varied between locations, with a lower index value in Goundry (index = 0.29) compared to peri-urban (index = 0.56) and urban (index = 0.55) the overall spatial correlation of the distribution is consistently high (Pearson correlation = 0.74) regardless of the location.

The key findings indicate that the arbovirus vector Ae. aegvpti is common throughout Ouagadougou, and most abundant in the highly populated central areas where infestation rates reach 78% of dwellings. Adult females are predominantly anthropophagic and also highly exophilic, though feeding more indoors than exophily rates would suggest. Females also appear to oviposit in all container types, both in use or discarded. The key container habitats, those harboring the highest numbers of pupae, and from which the greatest numbers of adults emerge, were discarded car tires, large domestic water containers (drums and barrels) and small containers (including discarded vessels). Aedes aegypti were caught in both mornings and evenings, consistent with their expected pattern of diurnal activity, but it is unclear to what extent they may also be nocturnally active. The profile in the rural outskirts of the city appears to be quite different. Here there was a greater diversity of mosquito species, the most common of which were Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes vittatus. The most productive containers in Goundry for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. vittatus were animal drinking water troughs. The most significant mosquito-borne disease risk here is malaria, though the presence of significant numbers of Ae. vittatus is of note pending more insight into any vectorial role it might have in this area. Aedes vittatus occurs throughout Africa, tropical Asia, and southern Europe and was recently discovered in the Caribbean [58]. Although its vectorial capacity is not known, it occurs in both sylvatic and peridomestic environments, feeds on humans and is involved in the maintenance and transmission of yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya, and dengue [59]. However, in the higher density urban and peri-urban areas within Ouagadougou, Ae. aegypti was the only arbovirus vector of concern and was, almost certainly, the only active vector during the dengue outbreaks of 2016 and 2017. The likelihood of future outbreaks of dengue and other arboviruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti is high and a programme to prevent, limit or respond to dengue outbreaks must now be considered a public health priority to protect urban populations. Ideally, dengue vector control programmes should involve two strategies, the first for vector population suppression, a year-round or pre wet season programme to maintain a low vector population, and the second strategy for responding rapidly to disease outbreaks[60]. Suppressing vector populations typically employs sustainable appropriate methods targeting the immature stage habitats. Diligent sustained action by community groups can have major impacts, and be effective in both outbreak prevention and response, even in the absence of insecticides [61\u201364]. This requires regular waste disposal for elimination of discarded materials, containers with no function and general garbage. Water barrels, tanks or jars or any other functional or in-use containers should have tightly fitting lids, while empty bottles and buckets should be stored inverted. Targeting the highly productive container types such as those that produce over 70% of all Ae. aegypti pupae, is recommended by WHO [28]. Although more work is required to identify all key container types in Ouagadougou in dry and wet seasons, it is already clear that car tires are an important habitat responsible for producing over 30% of adult vectors in the wet season, with drums and barrels used for water storage potentially increasing in importance in the dry season. Tires are a unique and easily recognised waste item, apparently with no monetary value and a successful campaign to remove them would be a useful milestone (while raising the difficult question of what to do with the tires collected). Before decisions are reached however, the survey should be repeated in the dry season, when the vector population will be at its lowest and most vulnerable level and the most productive container types might be different. Larviciding can also be used for larval reduction using temephos, an organophosphate and two biological insecticides Bti and pyriproxyfen. Preliminary data shows organophosphates are effective against Aedes aegypti larvae in Burkina [65], but data on efficacy of Bti and pyriproxyfen are awaited. Although the identification of key containers for pupal productivity may reduce the challenge, the diversity and the number of breeding containers will compromise larviciding as a stand-alone method for dengue control in Burkina Faso. Aedes aegypti adults can be prevented from entering buildings by screens fitted to windows, which do not necessarily need to be insecticide-treated to be effective [66,67]. Indoor resting can be controlled by targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS), where only the lower half of the walls are treated with insecticide or by using hand-held aerosol cans to spray known resting indoor sites [68\u201370]. Clearly, further work is required to fully elucidate resting preferences, a critical question for planning control, and the efficacy of IRS against Ae. aegypti in Africa need to be evaluated experimentally as a priority even if the exophilic behaviour may recommend additional control methods. The high levels of exophily recorded in this study (Fig 1) which doesn\u2019t exclude high exophagy levels in the same Aedes aegypti populations, raise the question of whether IRS is an appropriate method for control of Ae. aegypti in west Africa. Of the two Ae. aegypti forms known to occur in Burkina Faso, only Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa) exhibits synanthropic behaviour, including endophily and endophagy [71]. Endophilic behaviour has been documented in Ae. aegypti since the earliest research [72] and is a common feature of populations worldwide [73,74]. Throughout its range in Africa, substantial or even preferential outdoor activity by Aaa is not unusual, and has been reported from Ghana [75], Senegal [40] and Kenya [76]. Exophilic or endophilic preferences may not be exclusively one or the other, and many Ae. aegypti populations exhibit both. For example, in Kenya, Teesdale recorded details of Ae. aegypti daily cycles of movement in and out of houses [76], while a study in Mexico recorded indoor and outdoor biting and resting, with exophagy the more common [77]. Despite this, the studies demonstrating the impact of TIRS (Targeted Indoors Residual Spray) on Ae. aegypti were also performed in Mexico. In Burkina Faso, a significantly higher than expected proportion of bloodfed females are found resting indoors, which suggests that exophily may not dominate the entire adult stage and that adult females are likely endophagic or come indoors at some stage after bloodfeeding. The majority of bloodmeals were identified as human in origin, with the remainder from dogs and only one sample from cattle (S4 Table). Notably, only 6\u20137% of bloodmeals were non-human in samples from the urban localities, but 28% of bloodmeals in the semi-rural site were from dogs. Aedes aegypti exists in two forms in Africa, Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa) inhabit domestic environments, breed in artificial containers, and are highly anthropophagic, and Ae. aegypti formosus, (Aaf) the forest form which is zoophilic [78]. The abdominal scaling patterns used to discriminate the forms [42,79] were not found useful for discriminating forms among our samples from Ouagadougou [71]. Genetic studies have shown that the Ouagadougou population is an interbred population mixture of Aaa and Aaf, expressing intermediate animal and human preferences [4]. The results presented here point towards an urban population displaying predominantly Aaa behaviour and a rural population that is still anthropophilic but with a far greater likelihood of zoophagy [4]. Clarification of host preference is an important element of a mosquito population\u2019s vectorial capacity but doing so will require a larger sample size and additional studies to gain more insight. This should be prioritised together with the studies on indoor/outdoor feeding and resting preferences. Higher densities of adult Ae. aegypti were found in urban and peri-urban localities of 1200 LG and Tabtenga, compared to Goundry, the rural locality. Adults rested mainly outdoors in all sites, feeding preferentially on humans with rare canine or bovine bloodmeals and their densities were affected by month and the year of collection, the locality, the indoors/outdoors location and at a lesser extent by the immature stage abundance and the cumulative rain of 14 previous days. Ae. aegypti was the main Aedes species collected at all developmental stages, in all localities, in both years. Ae. aegypti adults and larvae densities followed a negative gradient from urban to rural localities. Urbanisation has been identified as the main driver of Ae. aegypti proliferation in Africa [4,80], and other environmental changes resulting from human activities promote higher abundance and lower species diversity; lower abundance and higher species diversity are more typical of natural environments and ecosystems [81]. In our study, the diversity of all culicines was greater in the rural site, Goundry, than in the urban and peri-urban localities. Goundry is predominantly agricultural land at the edge of the bush, with trees and scrubland beyond. Aedes vittatus was common here only, preferring animal drinking troughs as larval habitats. Also found only at Goundry, the predatory larvae of Lutzia tigripes shared some habitats with a prey species, Ae. aegypti and may have contributed to the lower densities of Ae. aegypti in Goundry compared to Tabtenga and 1200 LG. Important vector mosquitoes included Culex quinquefasciatus which was common here though not as abundant as at the other localities, and Anopheles gambiae s.l., which was common. Multiple containers types were found to contain larvae in urban and peri-urban sites, with tires the most common. The typology of containers may vary according to the locality. Drums and barrels that are used for water storage, are more abundant in the rural and peri-urban localities of Goundry and Tabtenga where piped water is either absent or rare. Studies in central and East Africa have reported tires as the main breeding sites for Aedes mosquitoes [80,82,83]. In Indonesia, the most abundant breeding containers were bird watering dishes, tires had the highest frequency of positivity, while large open tanks storing water (known as Bak Mandi) were the most productive containers [84]. The relative importance of any container is highly context-specific and any container\u2019s contribution to the vector population can easily be underestimated [85,86]. Breeding site characteristics that affect immature stages abundance and adult life history traits include among others, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, conductivity and salinity [87]. Characteristics such as dissolved solids, ammonia, nitrate, and organic matter vary significantly between urban and rural containers, which might explain some urban-rural differences in breeding of Ae. aegypti [88]. We examined a limited number of breeding sites characteristics and environmental variables and found that container types and water levels within, can increase larval density while containers that are in use, or classed as useful, decrease pupal density. Cumulative rainfall of the previous 14 days and mean temperature affect adult and pupal densities respectively. Investigations in Iquitos used a generalised additive model to highlight the important contribution to Ae. aegypti adult density of weather-related covariates including temperature, rainfall and wind [89]. Though our study did not consider other covariates related to breeding sites, the density of immature stages was the strongest covariate in the model contributing to adult density. Immature stages as well as adult densities were more affected by the month of collection with September the peak month of higher densities, compared to August and October. Although immature stages contributed to adult density, only pupal density was affected by adult abundance. The spatial distribution of adult and immature stage hotspots showed consistent overlapping and limited dispersal of adults from the immature stage location as shown in Lacon et al [90] and in Bonnet et al. [91] who showed that removing breeding sites had a direct impact on proliferation of adults. The lower overlap in adult vs. larval densities in the rural compared to urban locations might be explained by a closer proximity of vegetation around households in the former, which offer potentially suitable, but difficult to sample, resting places for adults. As the Stegomyia indices have not previously been reported from Burkina Faso, we do not know what levels are typical during a non-outbreak period. During our study, the Stegomyia index values exceeded the WHO threshold for dengue risk in the rural locality of Goundry; paradoxically as this was the site where the lowest numbers of adult Aedes aegypti were recorded, and far from the central area of Ouagadougou where mainly urban and cases were known to be concentrated. In addition, there is no evidence that any quantifiable associations exist between these indices of vector immature stages abundance and dengue transmission, and the thresholds have little value for prediction of dengue outbreaks [92,93]. Instead, research has moved to investigating whether numbers of adult female Ae. aegypti numbers can provide more accurate and reliable alerts [93]. In this study the number of total adults collected was highly correlated with the number of fed females collected and their density models shared the same explanatory variables. In contrast to Stegomyia indices, which are based on immature stage numbers, estimating the total number of adult Ae. aegypti can be more informative but remains challenging, with precision depending on the sampling methods and sampling efforts [37]. A pattern of similarities between spatial distribution of adults and immature stages are found, with hotspots overlapping in the urban sites, at least. More consistent indices are needed, to take into account Ae. aegypti resting and blood feeding behaviour, and the typology of breeding sites that are productive for pupae, yet potentially specific to the locality. Associating dengue active case detection in the community with holistic collection of Ae. aegypti bionomics collection could allow more consistent inferences to be made. Without vaccines for three of the four arboviruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti, Burkina Faso, like every other country, must rely on existing vector control tools as it plans its dengue control programme. Burkina Faso has endured a heavy malaria burden for decades during which time it built considerable capacity in vector control of Anopheles sp. [94]. It is now attempting the same for Ae. aegypti, a mosquito with very different biology and behavior to malaria vectors and consequently, requiring a different approach for control. Since so many larval habitats are essentially waste materials, clean-up campaigns accompanied by appropriate education and information programs are essential and, in fact have already been established in Ouagadougou [91]. However, selection and likelihood of success of even the most appropriate interventions should be based on more than method of delivery and insecticide susceptibility of the target population. Gaining access to a home to deliver indoor treatments may be prevented if occupants are out working or studying elsewhere. If this type of \u2018refusal\u2019 occurs at a high rate, achieving satisfactory coverage would be compromised. A house\u2019s structure, shape or construction materials can determine its suitability for fitted interventions such as window screens. Despite evidence that it is rarely effective [95], fogging or space-spraying outdoors is a popular response to Ae. aegypti borne arbovirus outbreaks worldwide. A high-profile activity, space-spraying is routine for many local authorities worldwide, the expected response to an outbreak although it can impact on transmission only if it is applied at frequent intervals and sustained for many weeks [89,90]. The exophilic character of the Aedes aegypti populations in Ouagadougou may support this method but as the same vector populations also show high resistance to pyrethroid insecticides [65,96], selection of insecticide should be based on up to date insecticide susceptibility testing together with safety considerations. Pending the clarification of the vector population\u2019s behavioral preferences in the key areas described above, a program for vector control of dengue in Burkina Faso should be possible despite the limited range of interventions available. The Wolbachia method offers unprecedented impacts [97] but a date when it might be considered affordable and biologically suitable for use in Africa, may be many years away. Until then, or until a time when another equally effective intervention method is available, existing methods should be sufficient to at least reduce the frequency and mitigate the impact of outbreaks. This report describes the Ae. aegypti population before and during dengue outbreaks in Ouagadougou. Although additional dry season data are required, the study provides the most complete contemporary description of an Ae. aegypti population in West Africa and provides sufficient evidence to develop programs for prevention and control of outbreaks. Recognizing that many of the breeding, bloodfeeding and resting site preferences reported here are likely to occur in vector populations elsewhere in West Africa, the importance of undertaking further research to characterize those habits in additional vector populations cannot be overly stressed. Together with insecticide resistance status, these preferences determine the success of any control method and where possible, characterization should be based on evidence rather than assumption, especially if based on contexts outside Africa. This study has done little to alter the view that the Stegomyia indices have limited epidemiological value or that they are likely to be more relevant in Africa than they have been elsewhere. Identifying alternatives however remains elusive. While there are similarities between immature stage and adult densities and similarities in spatial distribution, determining how these might be applied or how they could be combined with additional epidemiological parameters to generate more accurate indices reflecting the transmission potential of Ae. aegypti and disease risk remains a challenge. All of these topics fit well within a regional approach to arbovirus control. Networks mapping Ae. aegypti key behaviors across the African continent, together with accurate indices of arbovirus risk, insecticide susceptibility/resistance status and key epidemiological parameters would be an important step towards an effective regional/ global control strategy. Such an initiative is suspected to have broad support. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.s004 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.s005 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.s006 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.s007 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010059.s008 (DOCX) The authors thank members and leaders of communities in the localities of 1200 Logements, Tabtenga and Goundry for their permission to perform the study and their cooperation throughout.

        "the first person OR the same rate",
        "If someone drops two objects from the same height, one heavy, one light, which one will hit the ground first? If you are like most people, you may instinctively pick the heavier object. And why wouldn\u2019t you? After all, rocks fall faster than feathers. There are other factors besides weight that affect the speed of an object as it falls. This experiment will help students explore those factors, such as gravity and air. Students will use both their eyes and their ears to figure out how mass affects the speed at which something falls. For more information and ideas on how to implement the activity in your classroom check out the video. Mass: A measure of the amount of stuff (or matter) an object has. Not to be confused with weight or volume. Mass only says how much actual stuff there is, not how big an object is or how hard something is pulling on it. Weight: Mass (amount of stuff) times how hard the planet is pulling on it (gravity). This means that your weight on the moon will be 1/6 of that on Earth (gravity on the moon is 0.166 times of that on Earth). However, your mass will still be the same. Force: The push or pull an object feels because of interactions with other objects. If the interaction stops, then there is no force. It is formally defined as mass times acceleration. For example, gravity is a force that represents the pull the Earth has on all objects. Velocity: A measure of how fast something is going in some specific direction. Not to be confused with speed, which is only how fast something is moving. \u201cThe car was going 65 mph south on I-95\u201d is a measure of velocity. \u201cThe rollercoaster was moving at 65 mph when Billy got sick\u201d is a measure of speed. Acceleration: How fast the velocity is changing. When something accelerates it changes how fast it is going or the direction in which it is moving. For a positive change in acceleration means that the object is moving faster, a car going from 30 mph to 40 mph. A negative change means the object is moving slower, the car is going from 40mph to 30 mph. Finally, a change in the direction of the object\u2019s velocity without changing speed, such as if a car is moving North and turns East still moving, then the car accelerated because the direction of the car\u2019s velocity changed. Remember that velocity is a vector with direction and magnitude, therefore changes in any (or both) of those factors will produce an acceleration. Air resistance: The force air exerts on something moving through it. When an object with a bigger surface falls through air, it feels more air resistance. Air resistance does not depend on the mass of the object. Before the activity students should know: Gravity from the Earth makes things fall by pulling objects toward the ground AFTER the activity students should know: If someone showed you two spheres of the same size but with different masses, say 1g and 10kg, and asked which would hit the ground first after being dropped from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, what would you say? If you\u2019re like most people, you would say the 10kg sphere would hit the ground first. Aristotle said so too, and for 1,000 years everyone believed him. But doing the experiment would show you, besides a great view of Pisa, that in fact, both spheres hit the ground at the same time. This is exactly what Galileo did, showing the world that objects of different masses fall at the same rate. (This is also a good example of why it is important to do experiments yourself and not to just take someone else\u2019s word for it.) To start understanding why Galileo was right, we need to understand the difference between several physics words that are often jumbled together and confused: mass, weight, speed, velocity, acceleration, and force. Let\u2019s start with mass and weight. Mass is the amount of stuff an object has. Mass and weight are not the same thing: the mass of an object will stay the same no matter where it is in the Universe, but weight will not. If I had some amount of stuff, say an apple, and took it from the Earth to the Moon, I would still have the same amount of stuff: one apple (assuming I didn\u2019t get hungry on the trip). No matter where I put that one apple, I will always have the same amount of apple, unless I eat it. This means that here or on the Moon, my apple has the same mass. Mass has the unit of kilograms. Now, weight is the amount of mass times the force of gravity, or how hard a planet is pulling an object towards itself. Going back to our apple, that apple would be a lot easier to lift and put in my mouth on the Moon than on Earth, right? The Earth pulls on the apple harder than the moon would, because the pull of the Earth (gravity) is stronger than that of the Moon. Even though I have the same amount of stuff, the same mass, the weight of my apple is greater on Earth than it is on the Moon. Weight is mass times acceleration, this acceleration is from the gravity force that pulls the objects toward the ground. Weight has the unit of Newtons, which is the units of mass (kilograms) times the units of acceleration. But how do we sometimes get units of mass when we ask for the weight of things? That is because the scales we use to measure weight factor in the acceleration of the pull of the Earth on the object. This factor is a constant on the Earth, meaning that it is always the same if you are on Earth. If I were on the moon and my apple weighs .25 Newtons, I will need to know the value of the acceleration of gravity on the moon to find its mass. Now on to velocity, speed, acceleration and force. Velocity and speed are two different things, but the difference is very small. Velocity gives more information than speed does, because it tells us how fast something is moving in a specific direction. Speed is how fast something is going, but says nothing about the direction of that motion.. Acceleration says how much the velocity is changing in a specific direction. If something has a constant velocity, say moving south at 65 mph, there is no acceleration. Now how can you make something accelerate? To accelerate, an object needs to feel a force, that means a pull or a push. If you kick a football with some amount of force, the football is going to change its velocity, which means it\u2019s accelerating. Force is mass times acceleration. This means that force is the amount of stuff times how hard it is being pushed or pulled. The bigger the force (the stronger the kick), the bigger change in the football\u2019s acceleration, since its mass doesn\u2019t change. When something falls, it falls because of gravity. Because that object feels a force, it accelerates, which means its velocity gets bigger and bigger as it falls. The strength with which the Earth pulls on something in the form of gravity is a type of acceleration. Earth pulls on everything the exact same amount. Everything gets accelerated towards the Earth exactly the same way. The force that objects feel may be different because they have different masses, but the acceleration on Earth they experience is exactly the same. Weight is the force that acts on the mass due to gravity, because it is how much stuff there is times the acceleration at which is pulled towards the Earth, or any planet or moons. Because Earth gives everything the exact same acceleration, objects with different masses will still hit the ground at the same time if they are dropped from the same height. The first time you say that, no one will believe you because everyone has dropped a marble and a feather at the same time and they hit the floor at different times. That is not because of differences in the acceleration - which is constant on Earth, it is because air is pushing against the object in the opposite direction the Earth is pulling. This force is caused by air resistance. The less massive the object is, the more the force of air resistance slows the object down as it falls. If two objects were dropped on the moon, where there is no air, they would fall at the same rate no matter how much they differ in mass. The shape of the object can impact how much it is affected by air resistance. For example, if you drop a piece of paper horizontally, it has a lot of surface that is exposed to the air resistance. But if you drop the paper vertically, on the thin side, then there is less surface exposed to the air resistance. This means that, in that position, the paper will feel less push from the air and the same pull from the Earth. Two pieces of paper with the same mass dropped from the same height but with one in the horizontal position and the other in the vertical position will not hit the floor at the same time. Astronaut Neil Armstrong did an experiment on the moon to convince everyone that Galileo was right, that two objects of different mass and shape -in this case a feather and a hammer - in the absence of air resistance will hit the ground at the same time. Experiment 2 that you will be performing, two objects of different masses that roughly experience the same air resistance will be dropped and hopefully convince your kids that mass has nothing to do with how things fall. In the student\u2019s guide we have asked the students to design their own experiment to test if two objects of the same mass but different shape hit the ground at the same time. The idea is to encourage them to be creative, to understand how to design experiments, and to think like scientists and engineers. They are given a set of materials that they can use to do their experiments. This is to prompt them, but they should be allowed to use other materials in their design. As the teacher, you can ask prompting questions to get them to think about the different aspects of the experiments. Below are the full instructions for one possible design. The goal of the experiment is for students to understand that mass is not a factor that affects how objects fall, that they notice the shape matters and why it matters. Crumpling the paper or changing the direction in which the paper is dropped can support those ideas. They need to figure out which variables they should control for, for example dropping the papers at the same time or the presence of a strong air current, and consistency of the repeated experiments. We ask the students to follow the scientific method to design the experiment. The scientific method has five basic steps, plus one feedback step:  Students should reflect on how the masses of the two pieces of paper were the same, yet the crumpled piece hit the ground first. Why? For this experiment students are asked to design a way to test if two objects of different mass but similar shapes hit the ground at the same time. They have been given a different set of materials from Experiment 1. In this case there are other variables to control for, such as how similar or different shapes affect the result and the difference in mass between the two objects.If the mass is double but the shape is the same, will the objects hit the floor at the same time? As with Experiment 1, we have given you a possible set up for the experiment. But again, students should have freedom to create their own designs. In the kit there are different sets of balls, repeat the experiment with all the possible wooden and rubber balls combinations. Make sure to label the balls and measure them to make good comparisons. If you are working at home and do not have the exact materials, you can always substitute the balls with clay or playdough (see suggested resources for a recipe of homemade playdough). If you do not have either clay or playdough, then find two objects around the house that have the same shape but different weights. For example, two identical water bottles, one full and the other one with less water or no water. The purpose of this experiment is to test if objects with different masses but the same shape fall at the same time. Instead of aluminium tart pans you can use aluminum foil or any other type of paper/foil that will produce a sound when the dropped objects hit them. As with activity 1, we ask the students to follow the scientific method to design the experiment. Students should pay attention to how many bangs they heard each time they dropped the balls.

        "gravity AND motion",
        "Newton discovered the relationship between the motion of the Moon and the motion of a body falling freely on Earth. By his dynamical and gravitational theories, he explained Kepler\u2019s laws and established the modern quantitative science of gravitation. Newton assumed the existence of an attractive force between all massive bodies, one that does not require bodily contact and that acts at a distance. By invoking his law of inertia (bodies not acted upon by a force move at constant speed in a straight line), Newton concluded that a force exerted by Earth on the Moon is needed to keep it in a circular motion about Earth rather than moving in a straight line. He realized that this force could be, at long range, the same as the force with which Earth pulls objects on its surface downward. When Newton discovered that the acceleration of the Moon is 1/3,600 smaller than the acceleration at the surface of Earth, he related the number 3,600 to the square of the radius of Earth. He calculated that the circular orbital motion of radius R and period T requires a constant inward acceleration A equal to the product of 4\u03c02 and the ratio of the radius to the square of the time: The Moon\u2019s orbit has a radius of about 384,000 km (239,000 miles; approximately 60 Earth radii), and its period is 27.3 days (its synodic period, or period measured in terms of lunar phases, is about 29.5 days). Newton found the Moon\u2019s inward acceleration in its orbit to be 0.0027 metre per second per second, the same as (1/60)2 of the acceleration of a falling object at the surface of Earth. In Newton\u2019s theory every least particle of matter attracts every other particle gravitationally, and on that basis he showed that the attraction of a finite body with spherical symmetry is the same as that of the whole mass at the centre of the body. More generally, the attraction of any body at a sufficiently great distance is equal to that of the whole mass at the centre of mass. He could thus relate the two accelerations, that of the Moon and that of a body falling freely on Earth, to a common interaction, a gravitational force between bodies that diminishes as the inverse square of the distance between them. Thus, if the distance between the bodies is doubled, the force on them is reduced to a fourth of the original. Newton saw that the gravitational force between bodies must depend on the masses of the bodies. Since a body of mass M experiencing a force F accelerates at a rate F/M, a force of gravity proportional to M would be consistent with Galileo\u2019s observation that all bodies accelerate under gravity toward Earth at the same rate, a fact that Newton also tested experimentally. In Newton\u2019s equation F12 is the magnitude of the gravitational force acting between masses M1 and M2 separated by distance r12. The force equals the product of these masses and of G, a universal constant, divided by the square of the distance. The constant G is a quantity with the physical dimensions (length)3/(mass)(time)2; its numerical value depends on the physical units of length, mass, and time used. (G is discussed more fully in subsequent sections.) The force acts in the direction of the line joining the two bodies and so is represented naturally as a vector, F. If r is the vector separation of the bodies, then In this expression the factor r/r3 acts in the direction of r and is numerically equal to 1/r2. The attractive force of a number of bodies of masses M1 on a body of mass M is where \u03a31 means that the forces because of all the attracting bodies must be added together vectorially. This is Newton\u2019s gravitational law essentially in its original form. A simpler expression, equation (5), gives the surface acceleration on Earth. Setting a mass equal to Earth\u2019s mass ME and the distance equal to Earth\u2019s radius rE, the downward acceleration of a body at the surface g is equal to the product of the universal gravitational constant and the mass of Earth divided by the square of the radius:  The weight W of a body can be measured by the equal and opposite force necessary to prevent the downward acceleration; that is Mg. The same body placed on the surface of the Moon has the same mass, but, as the Moon has a mass of about 1/81 times that of Earth and a radius of just 0.27 that of Earth, the body on the lunar surface has a weight of only 1/6 its Earth weight, as the Apollo program astronauts demonstrated. Passengers and instruments in orbiting satellites are in free fall. They experience weightless conditions even though their masses remain the same as on Earth. Equations (1) and (2) can be used to derive Kepler\u2019s third law for the case of circular planetary orbits. By using the expression for the acceleration A in equation (1) for the force of gravity for the planet GMPMS/R2 divided by the planet\u2019s mass MP, the following equation, in which MS is the mass of the Sun, is obtained:  Kepler\u2019s very important second law depends only on the fact that the force between two bodies is along the line joining them. Newton was thus able to show that all three of Kepler\u2019s observationally derived laws follow mathematically from the assumption of his own laws of motion and gravity. In all observations of the motion of a celestial body, only the product of G and the mass can be found. Newton first estimated the magnitude of G by assuming Earth\u2019s average mass density to be about 5.5 times that of water (somewhat greater than Earth\u2019s surface rock density) and by calculating Earth\u2019s mass from this. Then, taking ME and rE as Earth\u2019s mass and radius, respectively, the value of G was which numerically comes close to the accepted value of 6.6743 \u00d7 10\u221211 m3 s\u22122 kg\u22121, first directly measured by Henry Cavendish. Comparing equation (5) for Earth\u2019s surface acceleration g with the R3/T2 ratio for the planets, a formula for the ratio of the Sun\u2019s mass MS to Earth\u2019s mass ME was obtained in terms of known quantities, RE being the radius of Earth\u2019s orbit:  The motions of the moons of Jupiter (discovered by Galileo) around Jupiter obey Kepler\u2019s laws just as the planets do around the Sun. Thus, Newton calculated that Jupiter, with a radius 11 times larger than Earth\u2019s, was 318 times more massive than Earth but only 1/4 as dense."

        "the first person AND the same rate",
        "A standard drink is 12 ounces of beer, four ounces of wine or 1-1/4 ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits. They all contain about the same amount of pure alcohol (about 1/2 ounce). These amounts are dependent upon the percentage of alcohol by volume and many beers, wines, and spirits do not follow this standard. \n Beverage  Drink Size  Abv  Light Beer  14 oz  4.20%  Regular Beer  12 oz  5.00%  Micro Brew  9 oz  6.70%  White Wine  5 oz  12.0%  Red Wine  4 oz  15.0%  80 Proof  1.5 oz  40.0%  About five percent of the alcohol consumed leaves the body through urine, sweat glands, and breathing. Most of the alcohol must be broken down (metabolized) by the liver to remove it from the system. The liver metabolizes alcohol at a very constant rate, approximately one drink per hour. If there is excessive alcohol in the blood, the liver cannot speed up the detoxification process. The unmetabolized alcohol just continues to circulate in the bloodstream. This is intoxication \u2013 when there is a buildup of alcohol in the system. Allowing the liver enough time to metabolize the alcohol is the only way to remove alcohol from the body. A cold shower, fresh air, exercise, or black coffee will not help sober a person up. Time is the only thing that will remove alcohol from the system (about an hour per standard drink). Alcohol does not require digestion. Most passes into the stomach. About 20 percent is absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach. The other 80 percent passes into the small intestine, where absorption is faster. The pyloric valve, which separates the stomach from the small intestine, closes when food is present in the stomach (especially protein and fatty foods). Therefore, food slows intoxication. The amount of alcohol in the body is measured as blood alcohol concentration (BAC). A BAC of .08 percent is the equivalent of 1/8 of a drop of alcohol to 1000 drops of blood. The body is very sensitive to alcohol. A person with a BAC of .30 percent may lapse into a coma, and a BAC of .40 percent can result in death. How can you tell what a person\u2019s BAC is? You can\u2019t unless you have special equipment like a Breathalyzer. ABC does not expect you to know what a person\u2019s BAC level is, but you should rely on how a customer looks and acts to determine if you should sell alcoholic beverages to them. \n BAC percent  Effects of Increased BAC Levels on a Typical Person  .01 - .03  No apparent effects, slight mood elevation. In California, you will test as legally impaired at .01 percent BAC if you are under 21.  .04 - .06  Feeling of relaxation, sensation of warmth, minor impairment of reasoning and memory  .07 - .09  Mild impairment of balance, speech, vision, and control. In California, you will test as legally impaired at .08 percent BAC if you are over 21.  .10 - .12  Significant impairment of motor coordination and loss of judgment, speech may be slurred  .13 - .15  Gross impairment of motor control, blurred vision and major loss of balance, onset of dysphoria (anxiety, restlessness)  .16 - .20  Dysphoria predominates, nausea may appear, drinker has the appearance of \u201csloppy drunk\u201d  .25 - .30  Severe intoxication, needs assistance walking, mental confusion, dysphoria with nausea and some vomiting  .35 - .40  Loss of consciousness, brink of coma  .40 & up  Onset of coma, likelihood of death due to respiratory failure \n Alcohol is a depressant drug. Despite the initial feeling of energy it gives, alcohol affects judgment and inhibitions while slowing reaction times. Alcohol also depletes the body\u2019s fluids and can cause a person to feel thirst. As a result, someone drinking may continue to drink more. Alcohol causes the small blood vessels on the surface of the skin to dilate. This result is the loss of body heat. The drinker feels like they are getting warm, but in fact the body is chilling. Normally, the liver maintains the body\u2019s blood sugar levels, but when alcohol is present, the liver metabolizes alcohol before its other functions. Diabetics are not the only persons who need to be aware of this disruption in blood sugar levels. To the average person, effects after alcohol has entered the bloodstream may be hunger, nausea, and hangovers, which are all caused by a drop in the blood sugar level. Alcohol affects each person differently. It also affects the same person differently on different occasions. The following are some of the factors that affect how quickly a person will become intoxicated: Gender \u2013 Alcohol affects men and women differently. In some women, the effects of alcohol tend to be stronger and last longer. This may be due to women having higher levels of estrogen, body fat, and lower levels of body water than men. All of which limits the amount of alcohol absorbed into tissues, thus remaining in the bloodstream. Men, on the other hand, typically have more of the enzymes that break down alcohol in the stomach before being absorbed into their bloodstream. Mood \u2013 Alcohol exaggerates the mood of a person. An individual who is depressed may become severely depressed while drinking. People who are fatigued or stressed become intoxicated more quickly than people who are rested and relaxed. Physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion will increase the impairment caused by alcohol. Food in the stomach \u2013 Food slows down the rate of intoxication because food causes the pyloric valve at the bottom of the stomach to close while digestion takes place. This keeps alcohol from entering the small intestine, where most of it is absorbed. The best foods for slowing intoxication are greasy, high-protein and fatty foods because they are more difficult to digest and stay in the stomach longer. For example: meat balls, chicken wings, cheese, pizza, dips, fried foods, nachos, and beef tacos. Amount of alcohol consumed \u2013 The more alcohol a person consumes, the more it accumulates in the blood, increasing intoxication. The liver can only get rid of about one drink per hour. Speed of consumption \u2013 A person who drinks rapidly or gulps drinks becomes intoxicated faster than a person who sips or drinks slowly because they ingest a larger amount of alcohol over the same period. Tolerance to alcohol \u2013 Tolerance is the body\u2019s ability to adapt to toxic substances like alcohol. Tolerance varies from person to person, but some have a naturally high tolerance, while others may develop high tolerance through habitual drinking. A person with a high tolerance may appear sober to others when they are extremely impaired. Physical condition \u2013 A person who is out of shape becomes intoxicated more quickly than a person who is muscular. Fat does not absorb blood, water, or alcohol, while muscle does. Medication/Drugs \u2013 Mixing alcohol and medications/drugs together can lead to serious physical, behavioral, and health complications. Not only can alcohol and drugs increase the effects of each substance, they can also trigger dangerous interactions. The side effects of combining alcohol with drugs may range from mere discomfort to life-threatening reactions. Alcohol should not be sold to a person who has taken any drug. Carbonation \u2013 Carbonated alcoholic drinks increase the rate of alcohol absorption. This is because the pressure inside the stomach and small intestine force the alcohol to be absorbed more quickly into the bloodstream. Sugars and juices mixed with alcohol also speed up the absorption rate. Altitude \u2013 Drinks consumed at high altitudes are nearly twice as potent in their effect for the first few days until the person becomes accustomed to the elevation.

        "the first person AND the same rate",
        "Q1:\u00a0 When did Social Security start?  A: The Social Security Act was signed \n              by FDR on 8/14/35. Taxes were collected for the first time in \n              January 1937 and the first one-time, lump-sum payments were made \n              that same month. Regular ongoing monthly benefits started in January \n              1940.  Q4:\u00a0 Is it true that Social Security was originally \n              just a retirement program?\n\nA:\u00a0 Yes. Under the 1935 law, what we now think of as Social \n              Security only paid retirement benefits to the primary worker. A \n              1939 change in the law added survivors benefits and benefits for \n              the retiree's spouse and children. In 1956 disability benefits were \n              added. Keep in mind, however, that the Social Security Act itself was \n              much broader than just the program which today we commonly describe \n              as \"Social Security.\" The original 1935 law contained \n              the first national unemployment compensation program, aid to the \n              states for various health and welfare programs, and the Aid to Dependent \n              Children program. (Full text of the 1935 \n              law.) Q5:\u00a0 Is it true \n              that members of Congress do not have to pay into Social Security?\n\n              A:\u00a0 No, it is not true. All members of Congress, the President \n              and Vice President, Federal judges, and most political appointees, \n              were covered under the Social Security program starting in January \n              1984. They pay into the system just like everyone else. Thus all \n              members of Congress, no matter how long they have been in office, \n              have been paying into the Social Security system since January 1984. (Prior to this time, most Federal government workers and officials \n              were participants in the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) \n              which came into being in 1920--15 years before the Social Security \n              system was formed. For this reason, historically, Federal employees \n              were not participants in the Social Security system.) Employees of the three branches of the federal government, were \n              also covered starting in January 1984, under the 1983 law--but with \n              some special transition rules.  1) Executive and judicial branch employees hired before January \n              1, 1984 were given a one-time irrevocable choice of whether to switch \n              to Social Security or stay under the old CSRS. (Rehired employees--other \n              than rehired annuitants--are treated like new employees if their \n              break-in-service was more than a year.) 2) Employees of the legislative branch who were not participating \n              in the CSRS system were mandatorily covered, regardless of when \n              their service began. Those who were in the CSRS system were given \n              the same one-time choice as employees in the executive and judicial \n              branches.  3) All federal employees hired on or after January 1, 1984 are \n              mandatorily covered under Social Security--the CSRS system is not \n              an option for them.\n\n              So there are still some Federal employees, those first hired prior \n              to January 1984, who are not participants in the Social Security \n              system. All other Federal government employees participate in Social \n              Security like everyone else.\n\n              This change was part of the 1983 Amendments to Social Security. \n              You can find a summary of the \n              1983 amendments elsewhere on this site.\n Q9:\u00a0 What information \n              is available from Social Security records to help in genealogical \n              research?\n\nA:\u00a0 You might want to start by checking out the Social \n              Security Death Index which is available online from a variety of \n              commercial services (usually the search is free). The Death Index \n              contains a listing of persons who had a Social Security number, \n              who are deceased, and whose death was reported to the Social Security \n              Administration. (The information in the Death Index for people who \n              died prior to 1962 is sketchy since SSA's death information was \n              not automated before that date. Death information for persons who \n              died before 1962 is generally only in the Death Index if the death \n              was actually reported to SSA after 1962, even though the death occurred \n              prior to that year.)  If you find a person in the Death Index you will learn the date \n              of birth and Social Security Number for that person. (The Social \n              Security Death Index is not published by SSA for public use, but \n              is made available by commercial entities using information from \n              SSA records. We do not offer support of these commercial products \n              nor can we answer questions about the material in the Death Index.)\n\n              Other records potentially available from SSA include the Application \n              for a Social Security Number (form SS-5). To obtain any information \n              from SSA you will need to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) \n              request.             Q11:\u00a0 Where do I get more information about the Social Security program as it exists today?\n\nA: Go to our Social Security Online home page.  Q12:\u00a0 Who \n              was the first person to get Social Security benefits?\n\nA: A fellow named Ernest \n              Ackerman got a payment for 17 cents in January 1937. This was \n              a one-time, lump-sum pay-out--which was the only form of benefits \n              paid during the start-up period January 1937 through December 1939. Q15:\u00a0 \n              What is the \"notch\"?\n\nA: In 1972 a technical error was introduced in the law which \n              resulted in beneficiaries getting a double adjustment for inflation. \n              In 1977 Congress acted to correct the error. Instead of making the \n              correction immediate, they phased it in over a five year period \n              (this is the notch period). This phase-in period was defined as \n              affecting those people born in 1917-1921. Individuals in the notch \n              generally receive higher benefits than those born after the notch, \n              although they receive lower benefits than those born in the period \n              prior to the notch when the error was in effect. \n\nSee SSA Factsheet on the notch\nSee detailed Congressional study \n              of the issue Q16:\u00a0 Where \n              can I find the history of the tax rates over the years and the amount \n              of earnings subject to Social Security taxes?\n\nA:\u00a0 The history of the tax rates is available as an Adobe \n              PDF file. (Tax rate table). \n              There is also a table showing the maximum \n              amount of Social Security taxes that could have been paid since \n              the program began. There are also tables showing the minimum and maximum Social Security benefit for a retired worker who retires at age 62 and one who retires at age 65. \n\n              Also, there is a table showing the number of workers paying into \n              Social Security each year. (Covered \n                workers table) And also a table showing the ratio of covered \n                workers to beneficiaries. (Ratio \n                table) Q17:\u00a0 \n              What does FICA mean and why are Social Security taxes called \n              FICA contributions?\n\n              A:\u00a0 Social Security payroll taxes are collected under authority \n              of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). The payroll taxes \n              are sometimes even called \"FICA taxes.\" In the original \n              1935 law the benefit provisions were in Title II of the Act and \n              the taxing provisions were in a separate title, Title VIII. As part \n              of the 1939 Amendments, the Title VIII taxing provisions were taken \n              out of the Social Security Act and placed in the Internal Revenue \n              Code. Since it wouldn't make any sense to call this new section \n              of the Internal Revenue Code \"Title VIII,\" it was renamed \n              the \"Federal Insurance Contributions Act.\" So FICA is \n              nothing more than the tax provisions of the Social Security Act, \n              as they appear in the Internal Revenue Code. Q18:\u00a0 Is there \n              any significance to the numbers assigned in the Social Security \n              Number?\n\nA: Yes. Originally, the first three digits are assigned by the geographical \n              region in which the person was residing at the time he/she obtained \n              a number. Generally, numbers were assigned beginning in the northeast \n              and moving westward. So people on the east coast have the lowest \n              numbers and those on the west coast have the highest numbers.  \n              The remaining six digits in the number are more or less randomly \n              assigned and were organized to facilitate the early manual bookkeeping \n              operations associated with the creation of Social Security in the \n              1930s.\n              Beginning on June 25, 2011, the SSA implemented a new assignment methodology\n              for Social Security Numbers. The project is a forward looking initiative of the Social Security Administration (SSA) to help protect the integrity of the SSN by establishing a new randomized assignment methodology. SSN Randomization will also extend the longevity of the nine-digit SSN nationwide.\n\nFor more information on the randomization of Social Security Numbers, please visit this website: \nhttp://ssa.gov/employer/randomizationfaqs.html#a0=-1\n Q22:\u00a0 Does the \n              Social Security Number contain a code indicating the racial group \n              to which the cardholder belongs?\n\n              A:\u00a0 No. This is a myth. The Social Security Number does contain \n              a segment (the two middle numbers) known as \"the group number.\" \n              But this refers only to the numerical groups 01-99. It has nothing \n              to do with race. (See more detailed \n              explanation.)Financing  Q24:\u00a0 How much has Social Security paid out since it \n              started?\n\nA:\u00a0 From 1937 (when the first payments were made) through \n              2009 the Social Security program has expended   $11.3 trillion. \n             (See detailed tables of annual Social Security \n              payments 1937-2008.) (See also detail for Q26)  Q25:\u00a0 How much has Social Security taken in taxes and \n              other income since it started?\n\nA:\u00a0 From 1937 (when taxes were first collected) through \n              2009 the Social Security program has received  $13.8 trillion \n              in income.  (See detailed tables of annual Social Security \n              revenues 1937-2008.) (See also detail for Q26)  Q26:\u00a0 Has Social Security always taken in more money \n              each year than it needed to pay benefits?\n\n              A:\u00a0 No. So far there have been 11 years in which the Social \n              Security program did not take enough in FICA taxes to pay the current \n              year's benefits. During these years, Trust Fund bonds in the amount \n              of about $24 billion made up the difference. (See \n              detailed Table.) Q27:\u00a0 Do the Social Security Trust Funds earn interest?\n\n              A:\u00a0 Yes they do. By law, the assets of the Social Security \n              program must be invested in securities guaranteed as to both principal \n              and interest. The Trust Funds hold a mix of short-term and long-term \n              government bonds. The Trust Funds can hold both regular Treasury \n              securities and \"special obligation\" securities issued \n              only to federal trust funds. In practice, most of the securities \n              in the Social Security Trust Funds are of the \"special obligation\" \n              type. (See additional explanation \n              from SSA's Office of the Actuary.)\n\n              The Trust Funds earn interest which is set at the average market \n              yield on long-term Treasury securities. Interest earnings on the \n              invested assets of the combined OASI and DI Trust Funds were $55.5 \n              billion in calendar year 1999. This represented an effective annual \n              interest rate of 6.9 percent.\n\n              The Trust Funds have earned interest in every year since the program \n              began. More detailed information \n              on the Trust Fund investments can be found in the Annual \n              Report of the Social Security Trustees and on the Actuary's webpages concerning the Investment Transactions and Investment Holdings of the Trust Funds.  Q28:\u00a0 Did President Franklin Roosevelt make a set of \n              promises about Social Security, which have now been violated?\n\n              A:\u00a0 This question generally refers to a set of misinformation \n              that is propagated over the Internet (usually via email) from time \n              to time. (See a detailed explanation \n              here.) Q29:\u00a0 I have seen a set of questions and answers on \n              the Internet concerning who started the taxing of Social Security \n              benefits, and questions like that. Are the answers given correct?\n\n              A:\u00a0 There are many varieties of questions and answers of this \n              form circulating on the Internet. One fairly widespread form of \n              the questions is filled with misinformation. (See \n              a detailed explanation here.)

        "the first person AND the same rate",
        "Advances in the field of genomics over the past quarter-century have led to substantial reductions in the cost of genome sequencing. The underlying costs associated with different methods and strategies for sequencing genomes are of great interest because they influence the scope and scale of almost all genomics research projects. Significant scrutiny and attention have been given to genome-sequencing costs and how they are calculated since the beginning of the field of genomics in the late 1980s. For example, NHGRI has carefully\u00a0tracked costs per genome\u00a0at its funded 'genome sequencing centers' for many years (see Figure 1). With the growing scale of human genetics studies and the increasing number of clinical applications for genome sequencing, even greater attention is being paid to understanding the underlying costs of generating a human genome sequence. Accurately determining the cost for sequencing a given genome (e.g., a human genome) is not simple. There are many parameters to define and nuances to consider. In fact, it is difficult to cite precise genome-sequencing cost figures that mean the same thing to all people because, in reality, different researchers, research institutions, and companies typically track and account for such costs in different fashions. A genome consists of all of the DNA contained in a cell's nucleus. DNA is composed of four chemical building blocks or \"bases\" (for simplicity, abbreviated G, A, T, and C), with the biological information encoded within DNA determined by the order of those bases. Diploid organisms, like humans and all other mammals, contain duplicate copies of almost all of their DNA (i.e., pairs of chromosomes; with one chromosome of each pair inherited from each parent). The size of an organism's genome is generally considered to be the total number of bases in one representative copy of its nuclear DNA. In the case of diploid organisms (like humans), that corresponds to the sum of the sizes of one copy of each chromosome pair. Organisms generally differ in their genome sizes. For example, the genome of\u00a0E. coli\u00a0(a bacterium that lives in your gut) is ~5 million bases (also called megabases), that of a fruit fly is ~123 million bases, and that of a human is ~3,000 million bases (or ~3 billion bases). There are also some surprising extremes, such as with the loblolly pine tree - its genome is ~23 billion bases in size, over seven times larger than ours. Obviously, the cost to sequence a genome depends on its size. The discussion below is focused on the human genome; keep in mind that a single 'representative' copy of the human genome is ~3 billion bases in size, whereas a given person's actual (diploid) genome is ~6 billion bases in size. Genomes are large and, at least with today's methods, their bases cannot be 'read out' in order (i.e., sequenced) end-to-end in a single step. Rather, to sequence a genome, its DNA must first be broken down into smaller pieces, with each resulting piece then subjected to chemical reactions that allow the identity and order of its bases to be deduced. The established base order derived from each piece of DNA is often called a 'sequence read,' and the collection of the resulting set of sequence reads (often numbering in the billions) is then computationally assembled back together to deduce the sequence of the starting genome. Sequencing human genomes are nowadays aided by the availability of available 'reference' sequences of the human genome, which play an important role in the computational assembly process. Historically, the process of breaking down genomes, sequencing the individual pieces of DNA, and then reassembling the individual sequence reads to generate a sequence of the starting genome was called 'shotgun sequencing' (although this terminology is used less frequently today). When an entire genome is being sequenced, the process is called 'whole-genome sequencing.' See Figure 2 for a comparison of human genome sequencing methods during the time of the Human Genome Project and circa ~ 2016.  An alternative to whole-genome sequencing is the targeted sequencing of part of a genome. Most often, this involves just sequencing the protein-coding regions of a genome, which reside within DNA segments called 'exons' and reflect the currently 'best understood' part of most genomes. For example, all of the exons in the human genome (the human 'exome') correspond to ~1.5% of the total human genome. Methods are now readily available to experimentally 'capture' (or isolate) just the exons, which can then be sequenced to generate a 'whole-exome sequence' of a genome. Whole-exome sequencing does require extra laboratory manipulations, so a whole-exome sequence does not cost ~1.5% of a whole-genome sequence. But since much less DNA is sequenced, whole-exome sequencing is (at least currently) cheaper than whole-genome sequencing. Another important driver of the costs associated with generating genome sequences relates to data quality. That quality is heavily dependent upon the average number of times each base in the genome is actually 'read' during the sequencing process. During the Human Genome Project (HGP), the typical levels of quality considered were: (1) 'draft sequence' (covering ~90% of the genome at ~99.9% accuracy); and (2) 'finished sequence' (covering >95% of the genome at ~99.99% accuracy). Producing truly high-quality 'finished' sequence by this definition is very expensive; of note, the process of 'sequence finishing' is very labor-intensive and is thus associated with high costs. In fact, most human genome sequences produced today are 'draft sequences' (sometimes above and sometimes below the accuracy defined above). There are thus a number of factors to consider when calculating the costs associated with genome sequencing. There are multiple different types and quality levels of genome sequences, and there can be many steps and activities involved in the process itself. Understanding the true cost of a genome sequence therefore requires knowledge about what was and was not included in calculating that cost (e.g., sequence data generation, sequence finishing, upfront activities such as mapping, equipment amortization, overhead, utilities, salaries, data analyses, etc.). In reality, there are often differences in what gets included when estimating genome-sequencing costs in different situations. Below is summary information about: (1) the estimated cost of sequencing the first human genome as part of the HGP; (2) the estimated cost of sequencing a human genome in 2006 (i.e., roughly a decade ago); and (3) the estimated cost of sequencing a human genome in 2016 (i.e., the present time). The HGP generated a 'reference' sequence of the human genome - specifically, it sequenced one representative version of all parts of each human chromosome (totaling ~3 billion bases). In the end, the quality of the 'finished' sequence was very high, with an estimated error rate of <1 in 100,000 bases; note this is much higher than a typical human genome sequence produced today. The generated sequence did not come from one person's genome, and, being a 'reference' sequence of ~3 billion bases, really reflects half of what is generated when an individual person's ~6-billion-base genome is sequenced (see below). The HGP involved first mapping and then sequencing the human genome. The former was required at the time because there was otherwise no 'framework' for organizing the actual sequencing or the resulting sequence data. The maps of the human genome served as 'scaffolds' on which to connect individual segments of assembled DNA sequence. These genome-mapping efforts were quite expensive, but were essential at the time for generating an accurate genome sequence. It is difficult to estimate the costs associated with the 'human genome mapping phase' of the HGP, but it was certainly in the many tens of millions of dollars (and probably hundreds of millions of dollars). Once significant human genome sequencing began for the HGP, a 'draft' human genome sequence (as described above) was produced over a 15-month period (from April 1999 to June 2000). The estimated cost for generating that initial 'draft' human genome sequence is ~$300 million\u00a0worldwide, of which NIH provided roughly 50-60%. The HGP then proceeded to refine the 'draft' and produce a 'finished' human genome sequence (as described above), which was achieved by 2003. The estimated cost for advancing the 'draft' human genome sequence to the 'finished' sequence is ~$150 million\u00a0worldwide. Of note, generating the final human genome sequence by the HGP also relied on the sequences of small targeted regions of the human genome that were generated before the HGP's main production-sequencing phase; it is impossible to estimate the costs associated with these various other genome-sequencing efforts, but they likely total in the tens of millions of dollars. The above explanation illustrates the difficulty in coming up with a single, accurate number for the cost of generating that first human genome sequence as part of the HGP. Such a calculation requires a clear delineation about what does and does not get 'counted' in the estimate; further, most of the cost estimates for individual components can only be given as ranges. At the lower bound, it would seem that this cost figure is at least $500 million; at the upper bound, this cost figure could be as high as $1 billion. The truth is likely somewhere in between. The above estimated cost for generating the first human genome sequence by the HGP should not be confused with the total cost of the HGP. The originally projected cost for the U.S.'s contribution to the HGP was $3 billion; in actuality, the Project ended up taking less time (~13 years rather than ~15 years) and requiring less funding - ~$2.7 billion. But the latter number represents the total U.S. funding for a wide range of scientific activities under the HGP's umbrella beyond human genome sequencing, including technology development, physical and genetic mapping, model organism genome mapping and sequencing, bioethics research, and program management. Further, this amount does not reflect the additional funds for an overlapping set of activities pursued by other countries that participated in the HGP. As the HGP was nearing completion, genome-sequencing pipelines had stabilized to the point that NHGRI was able to collect fairly reliable cost information from the major sequencing centers funded by the Institute. Based on these data, NHGRI estimated that the hypothetical 2003 cost to generate a 'second' reference human genome sequence using the then-available approaches and technologies was in the neighborhood of $50 million. Since the completion of the HGP and the generation of the first 'reference' human genome sequence, efforts have increasingly shifted to the generation of human genome sequences from individual people. Sequencing an individual's 'personal' genome actually involves establishing the identity and order of ~6 billion bases of DNA (rather than a ~3-billion-base 'reference' sequence; see above). Thus, the generation of a person's genome sequence is a notably different endeavor than what the HGP did. Within a few years following the end of the HGP (e.g., in 2006), the landscape of genome sequencing was beginning to change. While revolutionary new DNA sequencing technologies, such as those in use today, were not quite implemented at that time, genomics groups continued to refine the basic methodologies used during the HGP and continued lowering the costs for genome sequencing. Considerable efforts were being made to the sequencing of nonhuman genomes (much more so than human genomes), but the cost-accounting data collected at that time can be used to estimate the approximate cost that would have been associated with human genome sequencing at that time. Based on data collected by NHGRI from the Institute's funded genome-sequencing groups, the cost to generate a high-quality 'draft' human genome sequence had dropped to ~$14 million by 2006. Hypothetically, it would have likely cost upwards of $20-25 million to generate a 'finished' human genome sequence - expensive, but still considerably less so than for generating the first reference human genome sequence. The decade following the HGP brought revolutionary advances in DNA sequencing technologies that are fundamentally changing the nature of genomics. So-called 'next-generation' DNA sequencing methods arrived on the scene, and their effects quickly became evident in terms of\u00a0lowering genome-sequencing costs; note that these NHGRI-collected data are 'retroactive' in nature, and do not always accurately reflect the 'projected' costs for genome sequencing going forward). In 2015, the most common routine for sequencing an individual's human genome involves generating a 'draft' sequence and comparing it to a reference human genome sequence, so as to catalog all sequence variants in that genome; such a routine does not involve any sequence finishing. In short, nearly all human genome sequencing in 2015 yields high-quality 'draft' (but unfinished) sequence. That sequencing is typically targeted to all exons (whole-exome sequencing) or aimed at the entire ~6-billion-base genome (whole-genome sequencing), as discussed above. The quality of the resulting 'draft' sequences is heavily dependent on the amount of average base redundancy provided by the generated data (with higher redundancy costing more). Adding to the complex landscape of genome sequencing in 2015 has been the emergence of commercial enterprises offering genome-sequencing services at competitive pricing. Direct comparisons between commercial versus academic genome-sequencing operations can be particularly challenging because of the many nuances about what each includes in any cost estimates (with such details often not revealed by private companies). The cost data that NHGRI collects from its funded genome-sequencing groups includes information about a wide range of activities and components, such as: reagents, consumables, DNA-sequencing instruments, certain computer equipment, other equipment, laboratory pipeline development, laboratory information management systems, initial data processing, submission of data to public databases, project management, utilities, other indirect costs, labor, and administration. Note that such cost-accounting does not typically include activities such as quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), alignment of generated sequence to a reference human genome, sequence assembly, genomic variant calling, or annotation. Almost certainly, companies vary in terms of which of the items in the above lists get included in any cost estimates, making direct cost comparisons with academic genome-sequencing groups difficult. It is thus important to consider these variables - along with the distinction between retrospective versus projected costs - when comparing genome-sequencing costs claimed by different groups. Anyone comparing costs for genome sequencing should also be aware of the distinction between 'price' and 'cost' - a given price may be either higher or lower than the actual cost. Based on the\u00a0data\u00a0collected from NHGRI-funded genome-sequencing groups, the cost to generate a high-quality 'draft' whole human genome sequence in mid-2015 was just above $4,000; by late in 2015, that figure had fallen below $1,500. The cost to generate a whole-exome sequence was generally below $1,000. Commercial prices for whole-genome and whole-exome sequences have often (but not always) been slightly below these numbers. Innovation in genome-sequencing technologies and strategies does not appear to be slowing. As a result, one can readily expect continued reductions in the cost for human genome sequencing. The key factors to consider when assessing the 'value' associated with an estimated cost for generating a human genome sequence - in particular, the amount of the genome (whole versus exome), quality, and associated data analysis (if any) - will likely remain largely the same. With new DNA-sequencing platforms anticipated in the coming years, the nature of the generated sequence data and the associated costs will likely continue to be dynamic. As such, continued attention will need to be paid to the way in which the costs associated with genome sequencing are calculated.
