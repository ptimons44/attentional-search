    "https://manhattanda.org/district-attorney-bragg-announces-34-count-felony-indictment-of-former-president-donald-j-trump/": "Read the Indictment and the Statement of Facts Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. today announced the indictment of DONALD J. TRUMP, 76, for falsifying New York business records in order to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American voters before and after the 2016 election. During the election, TRUMP and others employed a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d scheme to identify, purchase, and bury negative information about him and boost his electoral prospects. TRUMP then went to great lengths to hide this conduct, causing dozens of false entries in business records to conceal criminal activity, including attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\u00a0 TRUMP is charged in a New York State Supreme Court indictment with 34 counts of Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree.[]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe People of the State of New York allege that Donald J. Trump repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal crimes that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election,\u201d said District Attorney Bragg. \u201cManhattan is home to the country\u2019s most significant business market. We cannot allow New York businesses to manipulate their records to cover up criminal conduct. As the Statement of Facts describes, the trail of money and lies exposes a pattern that, the People allege, violates one of New York\u2019s basic and fundamental business laws. As this office has done time and time again, we today uphold our solemn responsibility to ensure that everyone stands equal before the law.\u201d\u00a0 According to court documents and statements made on the record in court, from August 2015 to December 2017, TRUMP orchestrated his \u201ccatch and kill\u201d scheme through a series of payments that he then concealed through months of false business entries. \u00a0 In one instance, American Media Inc. (\u201cAMI\u201d), paid $30,000 to a former Trump Tower doorman, who claimed to have a story about a child TRUMP had out of wedlock.\u00a0\u00a0 In a second instance, AMI paid $150,000 to a woman who alleged she had a sexual relationship with TRUMP. When TRUMP explicitly directed a lawyer who then worked for the Trump Organization as TRUMP\u2019s Special Counsel (\u201cSpecial Counsel\u201d) to reimburse AMI in cash, the Special Counsel indicated to TRUMP that the payment should be made via a shell company and not by cash. AMI ultimately declined to accept reimbursement after consulting their counsel. AMI, which later admitted its conduct was unlawful in an agreement with federal prosecutors, made false entries in its business records concerning the true purpose of the $150,000 payment.\u00a0 In a third instance \u2013 12 days before the presidential general election \u2013 the Special Counsel wired $130,000 to an attorney for an adult film actress. The Special Counsel, who has since pleaded guilty and served time in prison for making the illegal campaign contribution, made the payment through a shell corporation funded through a bank in Manhattan. After winning the election, TRUMP reimbursed the Special Counsel through a series of monthly checks, first from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust \u2013 created in New York to hold the Trump Organization\u2019s assets during TRUMP\u2019s presidency \u2013 and later from TRUMP\u2019s bank account. In total, 11 checks were issued for a phony purpose. Nine of those checks were signed by TRUMP. Each check was processed by the Trump Organization and illegally disguised as a payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a non-existent retainer agreement. In total, 34 false entries were made in New York business records to conceal the initial covert $130,000 payment. Further, participants in the scheme took steps that mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the reimbursements.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Assistant D.A.s Catherine McCaw (Counsel to the Investigation Division), Katherine Ellis (Major Economic Crimes Bureau), Rebecca Mangold (Major Economic Crimes Bureau), Christopher Conroy (Senior Advisor to the Investigation Division), Susan Hoffinger (Chief of the Investigation Division), and Matthew Colangelo (Senior Counsel to the District Attorney) are handling the prosecution of this case with the assistance of Peter Pope (Executive Assistant D.A.), Steven Wu (Executive Assistant D.A. and Chief of the Appeals Division), and Alan Gadlin (Deputy Chief of the Appeals Division).

Harri Hursti has bought about 200 used voting machines without incident, but the one he purchased on eBay last month is now the subject of a state investigation, with Michigan officials determined to find out how the device ended up for sale online. \"We are actively working with law enforcement to investigate allegations of an illegal attempt to sell a voter assist terminal acquired in Michigan,\" Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is up for reelection in November, announced in a statement last week. And, in an additional tweet, Benson noted that the voting machine was originally from Wexford County and clarified that it was not used to tabulate ballots. (The Dominion-made apparatuses are built to function as voting machines or ballot printing devices. In Michigan, they were used to print voter ballots.) The U.S. Election Assistance Commission says voting machines should be meticulously inventoried and kept under lock and key \"in a tamper-proof location, preferably within the election office.\" Hursti is a cybersecurity expert who is often contracted by state-level election officials to test vulnerabilities in voting machines. That's why he bought the Dominion ImageCast X machine as soon as he saw it online, he told NPR during a phone interview. \"I've never taken a look inside one of those,\" he said, with some excitement. He forked over $1,200 then, in an effort to clarify any lingering questions about the ImageCast X's provenance, he sent an email to Michigan's secretary of state office alerting them of the deal. It's something he does whenever he buys a device online, he explained. It's a good thing he did. \"They didn't know a device was missing until they started looking to see if there's a missing machine,\" Hursti said. \"They really had no idea, and that is one of the biggest dangers\" to election security. As of Wednesday, the machine was still in the same unopened box it arrived in nearly two weeks ago. Hursti said he is waiting on the FBI or some other law enforcement agency to pick up the 2020 device from his home in Connecticut. \"I'm waiting to find out if it was stolen \u2014 that would make [the sale] illegal \u2014 or not. If it was not, then the machine is mine and I can get started\" on his analysis, he said. CNN has reported that the eBay seller, Ean Hutchison, who lives in Ohio, found the Dominion-made machine on a Michigan Goodwill website for just $7.99. He snapped it up then immediately put it up for sale on eBay. Hutchison did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. In the post on eBay, Hutchison stated that the device had been used in \"the most recent Michigan elections.\" Meanwhile, Michigan is one of several swing states, including Georgia and Colorado, where officials have launched investigations into possible election tampering or interference by Donald Trump supporters who hope to subvert the 2020 election. In nearly all cases, the election deniers claim they are searching for evidence of voter fraud. For Hursti, one of the greatest threats to voting devices is not necessarily hacking, but human incompetence. The 54-year-old is an expert in the field. He's been featured in two documentaries \u2014 Kill Chain: The Cyber War On America's Elections and the Emmy-nominated film, Hacking Democracy \u2014 that pull the curtain back on the U.S. election system. Both offer an unnerving glimpse into the weaknesses of today's election technology. He said he's seen instances where election officials or polling place volunteers inadvertently mishandle devices or do not follow security protocols. \"They just don't have the proper training,\" he said. In other cases, people simply fail to keep track of the machines. \"They leave them behind someplace and just totally forget them,\" he said, adding that there was one instance in which an election device was left behind at a hotel for more than a year. \"The hotel called and tried to tell them they left it but no one ever called back. So they sold it, which is legal for them to do.\" For those not in the know, Hursti said it sounds shocking to hear that voting machines can be bought and sold for little money. \"People think it's a big deal but it happens all the time. Most of the time the seller is a government, a county, or it is electric recycling. ... And it is a good thing because hackers are a resource to make things safer.\" Hackers like him, he said, are not interested in weaponizing the weaknesses they find. \"The reason you pop open the machine is to learn the vulnerabilities\" of each machine, in order to safeguard democracy, he added. And there are plenty of other machines to tinker with, while he waits for the Michigan investigation to unfold. \"I bought two others last month, so I'll get started on those,\" he said.

    "https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-science-voting-election-2020-6755cf1c409f4aab613df8891b84272d": " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The aftermath of the 2020 election put an intense spotlight on voting machines as supporters of former President Donald Trump claimed victory was stolen from him. While the theories were unproven \u2014 and many outlandish and blatantly false \u2014 election security experts say there are real concerns that need to be addressed. In Georgia, for example, election security expert J. Alex Halderman says he\u2019s identified \u201cmultiple severe security flaws\u201d in the state\u2019s touchscreen voting machines, according to a sworn declaration in a court case.  Halderman told The Associated Press in a phone interview that while he\u2019s seen no evidence the vulnerabilities were exploited to change the outcome of the 2020 election, \u201cthere remain serious risks that policymakers and the public need to be aware of\u201d that should be addressed immediately to protect future elections. Trump loyalists \u2014 pushing the slogan \u201cStop the Steal\u201d \u2014 held rallies, posted on social media and filed lawsuits in key states, often with false claims about Dominion Voting Systems voting machines. Almost all of the legal challenges casting doubt on the outcome of the election have been dismissed or withdrawn and many claims of fraud debunked. State and federal election officials have said there\u2019s no evidence of widespread fraud. And Dominion has fought back forcefully, filing defamation lawsuits against high-profile Trump allies.  As an election security researcher, it\u2019s been frustrating to watch the proliferation of misinformation, said Matt Blaze, a professor of computer science and law at Georgetown University. For years, he said, concerns raised by election security experts were dismissed as unimportant. \u201cAll of a sudden, people are going the other way, saying the existence of a flaw not only is something that should be fixed, it means the election was actually stolen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true either.\u201d David Cross is an attorney for plaintiffs in a long-running lawsuit filed by proponents of hand-marked paper ballots. His clients\u2019 concerns about Georgia\u2019s electronic voting machines long preceded the 2020 election, but he says they\u2019re now grappling with how to expose vulnerabilities and advocate for changes without fueling conspiracy theories. It\u2019s also frustrating, he said, to watch the state \u201ctry to dismiss actual scientific, rigorous examination of the voting equipment by just saying we\u2019re no different from the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 people when we\u2019re relying on the most respected election integrity experts in the country.\u201d Halderman, a voting technology specialist and director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Computer Security and Society, serves as an expert witness in the lawsuit, which was filed by individual voters and the Coalition for Good Governance.  In declarations submitted as part of the case in federal court in Atlanta, Halderman wrote that he had identified vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to \u201cinstall malicious software, either with temporary physical access (such as that of voters in the polling place) or remotely from election management systems.\u201d Once installed, he wrote, such malware \u201ccould alter voters\u2019 votes while subverting all the procedural protections practiced by the State.\u201d He detailed his findings in a report filed under seal last month as part of the lawsuit, which challenges the election system Georgia bought in 2019.  State officials have consistently argued that the Dominion machines have been thoroughly vetted and that security measures are in place to prevent problems. \u201cIn an ever-changing threat environment, there are always new evolving threats to any kind of election system,\u201d Ari Schaffer, a spokesman for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, said in an email. \u201cThat is why we are vigilant to the challenges that arise to the integrity of our elections. We are constantly in touch with federal and state security partners to protect our elections and keep them secure and reliable.\u201d The state paid more than $100 million for the new Dominion system, replacing the outdated equipment it had been using since 2002. First used statewide during last year\u2019s primary election, it includes touchscreen voting machines that produce paper ballots with barcodes tallied by scanners. Halderman said his 25,000-word report was the result of 12 weeks of intensive testing of Dominion equipment from Fulton County. All voters in Georgia use those machines, and at least some voters in 11 other states also use the same voting machines, according to data compiled by Verified Voting. Because it was filed under seal, The Associated Press hasn\u2019t seen Halderman\u2019s report or any specifics of the alleged vulnerabilities. It was also designated \u201cattorneys\u2019 eyes only,\u201d meaning even the actual parties to the lawsuit cannot see it. For that reason, no one in the secretary of state\u2019s office has seen the report, but Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs said, \u201cWe are familiar with these contentions. They are not new and Halderman\u2019s report is only possible because the judge gave him unrestricted access to equipment that he could not otherwise get.\u201d  Halderman, who has long argued that the touchscreen machines are vulnerable, said the access allowed him to identify for the first time specific vulnerabilities and the ways they could be exploited. He believes the information should force the state and Dominion to address the issues.  \u201cThat\u2019s just standard security practice,\u201d he said.  Halderman was tasked with evaluating the machines, not with looking for evidence that potential vulnerabilities had been exploited in a past election. During a conference call with the parties last month, U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg, who\u2019s presiding over the case, said she wasn\u2019t ready to unseal his report. But she did say she\u2019s \u201cconcerned enough about the information contained in it,\u201d according to a transcript.  \u201cI have seen how this can blow up,\u201d she added. Totenberg\u2019s past opinions in the case, which were critical of Georgia\u2019s election system, have been cited by people pushing conspiracy theories. Because of its confidential designation, the report hasn\u2019t been shared with Dominion. Halderman wrote that he\u2019s been trying since January, through the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, to arrange a meeting with Dominion but the company has not agreed to meet. \u201cDespite continued defamatory attacks against our company and its systems, Dominion has emerged from the 2020 election cycle with arguably the most-tested, most-scrutinized, and most-proven voting technology in recent history. Our company welcomes feedback that is provided in good faith by researchers,\u201d Dominion said in a statement. In response to Halderman\u2019s report, the state filed a rebuttal declaration from one of its own expert witnesses, Juan Gilbert.  Gilbert, chair of the computer and information science and engineering department at the University of Florida, wrote that \u201cany computer can be hacked with enough access and knowledge of a determined malicious actor.\u201d He added that while he believes electronic ballot-marking devices can be improved upon, that \u201cdoes not mean I believe they are so insufficiently secure as to be unconstitutional or otherwise impermissibly vulnerable.\u201d While Halderman says he has tested various methods of hacking that he says are generally undetectable, Gilbert wrote, \u201cI am not aware that Dr. Halderman has provided equipment marred by \u2018un-detectable\u2019 hacks to any other independent researcher to test his theory that it is, in fact, un-detectable and not correctable.\u201d Halderman countered in a declaration filed with the court that the declaration from Gilbert doesn\u2019t dispute the existence of the vulnerabilities he detailed or the steps that could be taken to alter individual votes and election outcomes. Nothing in Gilbert\u2019s declaration indicates that state officials understand how serious the problems are or have taken any steps to address them, Halderman wrote. He argued that state election officials \u201curgently need to engage with the findings in my report and address the vulnerabilities it describes before attackers exploit them.\u201d",

Yet repeated, false allegations of fraud can make it harder for millions of eligible Americans to participate in elections. It is important to protect the integrity of our elections. But we must be careful not to undermine free and fair access to the ballot in the name of preventing phantom voter fraud. Politicians at all levels of government have repeatedly, and falsely, claimed the 2016, 2018, and 2020 elections were marred by large numbers of people voting illegally. However, extensive research reveals that fraud is very rare, voter impersonation is virtually nonexistent, and many instances of alleged fraud are, in fact, mistakes by voters or administrators.\u00a0The same is true for\u00a0mail ballots, which are secure and essential to holding a safe election amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Brennan Center\u2019s seminal report The Truth About Voter Fraud\u00a0conclusively demonstrated that most allegations of fraud turn out to be baseless and that most of the few remaining allegations reveal irregularities and other forms of election misconduct. Numerous other studies, including one commissioned by the Trump administration, have reached the same conclusion. Voter fraud is unacceptable, but we must find solutions that address actual problems instead of imposing policies that make it harder for millions of eligible Americans to participate in our democracy. American elections are clean and trustworthy despite what President Trump and others claim. The hunt for nonexistent voter fraud is a pretext for efforts to intimidate eligible voters. A new report shows the broad reach of election denial among 2022 candidates for state and local offices that will run the 2024 elections. \n\n We respect your privacy.",

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.\n             PHILADELPHIA \u2013 United States Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams announced today that former U.S. Congressman Michael \u201cOzzie\u201d Myers, 79, of Philadelphia, PA, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to deprive voters of civil rights, bribery, obstruction of justice, falsification of voting records, and conspiring to illegally vote in a federal election for orchestrating schemes to fraudulently stuff the ballot boxes for specific Democratic candidates in the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 Pennsylvania elections. 39th Ward, 36th Division Specifically, Myers admitted in court to bribing the Judge of Elections for the 39th Ward, 36th Division in South Philadelphia, Domenick J. Demuro, in a fraudulent scheme over several years. Demuro, who was charged separately and pleaded guilty in May 2020, was responsible for overseeing the entire election process and all voter activities of his Division in accord with federal and state election laws. The voting machines at each polling station, including in the 39th Ward, 36th Division, generate records in the form of a printed receipt documenting the use of each voting machine. This printed receipt, also known as the \u201cresults receipt,\u201d shows the vote totals, and the Judge of Elections and other Election Board Officials at each polling place attest to the accuracy of machine results. Myers admitted to bribing Demuro to illegally add votes for certain candidates of their mutual political party in primary elections. Some of these candidates were individuals running for judicial office whose campaigns had hired Myers, and others were candidates for various federal, state, and local elective offices that Myers favored for a variety of reasons. Myers would solicit payments from his clients in the form of cash or checks as \u201cconsulting fees,\u201d and then use portions of these funds to pay Demuro and others to tamper with election results. After receiving payments ranging from between $300 to $5,000 per election from Myers, Demuro would add fraudulent votes on the voting machine \u2013 also known as \u201cringing up\u201d votes \u2013 for Myers\u2019 clients and preferred candidates, thereby diluting the value of ballots cast by actual voters. At Myers\u2019 direction, Demuro would add these fraudulent votes to the totals during Election Day, and then would later falsely certify that the voting machine results were accurate.\u00a0Myers is also accused of directing Demuro to lie to investigators about the circumstances of the bribes and the ballot-stuffing scheme. 39th Ward, 2nd Division Myers also admitted to conspiring to commit election fraud with a former Judge of Elections for the 39th Ward, 2nd Division in South Philadelphia, Marie Beren. Beren, who was charged separately and pleaded guilty in October 2021, was the de facto Judge of Elections and effectively ran the polling places in her division by installing close associates to serve as members of the Board of Elections. Myers admitted that he gave Beren directions to add votes to candidates supported by him, including candidates for judicial office whose campaigns actually hired Myers, and other candidates for various federal, state, and local elective offices preferred by Myers for a variety of reasons. Myers acknowledged in court that on almost every Election Day, Myers transported Beren to the polling station to open the polls. During the drive to the polling station, Myers would advise Beren which candidates he was supporting so that Beren knew which candidates should be receiving fraudulent votes. Inside the polling place and while the polls were open, Beren would advise actual in-person voters to support Myers\u2019 candidates and also cast fraudulent votes in support of Myers\u2019 preferred candidates on behalf of voters she knew would not or did not physically appear at the polls. During Election Day itself, Myers conferred with Beren via cell phone while she was at the polling station about the number of votes cast for his preferred candidates. Beren would report to Myers how many \u201clegit votes,\u201d meaning actual voters, had appeared at the polls and cast ballots. If actual voter turnout was high, Beren would add fewer fraudulent votes in support of Myers\u2019 preferred candidates. From time to time, Myers would instruct Beren to shift her efforts from one of his preferred candidates to another. Specifically, Myers would instruct Beren \u201cto throw support\u201d behind another candidate during Election Day if he concluded that his first choice was comfortably ahead. Beren and her accomplices from the Board of Elections would then falsify the polling books and the List of Voters and Party Enrollment for the 39th Ward, 2nd Division, by recording the names, party affiliation, and order of appearances for voters who had not physically appeared at the polling station to cast his or her ballot in the election. Beren took pains to ensure that the number of ballots cast on the machines was a reflection of the number of voters signed into the polling books and the List of Voters. After the polls closed on Election Day, Beren and her associates would falsely certify the results. \u201cVoting is the cornerstone of our democracy. If even one vote has been illegally cast or if the integrity of just one election official is compromised, it diminishes faith in process,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Williams. \u201cVotes are not things to be purchased and democracy is not for sale. If you are a political consultant, election official, or work with the polling places in any way, I urge you to do your job honestly and faithfully. That is what the public deserves and what the federal government will enforce.\u201d \u201cOne thing you can say about Ozzie Myers: his values have long been out of whack,\u201d said Jacqueline Maguire, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia Division. \u201cDecades ago, he valued a fake sheikh\u2019s bribes more than the ethical obligations of his elected federal office. This time around, he valued his clients\u2019 money and his own whims more than the integrity of multiple elections and the will of Philadelphia voters. Free and fair elections are critical to the health of our democracy, which is why protecting the legitimacy of the electoral process at every level is such a priority for the FBI.\u201d \u201cThe guilty plea entered today is a satisfying culmination of tireless work by our Pennsylvania State Troopers, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice. \u00a0It is imperative the citizens of this Commonwealth have faith in a fair voting process. \u00a0We will remain committed to prioritizing these investigations and working with our federal partners to fully investigate and prosecute anyone who attempts to impede or alter the election process.\u201d \u00a0Captain James Cuttitta, Director, Special Investigations Division, Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Pennsylvania State Police. \u00a0 This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the Pennsylvania State Police.

REUTERS/Paul Ratje/File Photo Nov 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump\u2019s stolen-election falsehoods have thrust America\u2019s voting machine suppliers into a national struggle to protect their businesses. Industry leaders Dominion Voting Systems and Election Systems & Software are waging a political and public relations ground war to beat back threats to their state and local government contracts, rooted in bogus conspiracy theories about vote manipulation. Dominion has also turned to the courts, filing eight defamation lawsuits against Trump allies and media outlets including Fox News. The efforts to fight misinformation have so far blocked any significant loss of business, in part because many counties and states are locked into long-term contracts for voting systems. But the companies are nonetheless taking the election-denial movement seriously as the belief in voter-fraud fictions continues to gain mainstream acceptance on the right. About two-thirds of U.S. Republicans say they believe the election was stolen from Trump, Reuters polls show. Whenever companies \"face a tsunami of suspicion and distrust of their products, that poses an existential threat to their livelihood and survival,\u201d said Mark Lindeman, policy and strategy director at Verified Voting, a U.S. nonprofit that promotes the use of secure voting technology. Dominion faces the most intense opposition because the company has featured prominently in right-wing theories alleging its equipment flipped votes from Trump to Biden in 2020. In all, Dominion has faced campaigns in at least a dozen jurisdictions across eight states by officials or activists seeking to replace Dominion voting systems based on unproven fraud allegations, according to a Reuters review of government records and interviews with local officials. Among the risks: a statewide voting-systems contract Dominion holds in Louisiana, which Trump won handily. Officials there have indefinitely delayed awarding a new contract worth about $100 million amid pressure from pro-Trump, anti-machine activists. In Tuesday\u2019s U.S. midterm elections, five counties facing voting-machine protests \u2014 in the states of Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Minnesota \u2014 plan to institute hand-counting of ballots as a check on their machine counts by Dominion or ES&S tabulating equipment. Among them is Nye County, Nevada, where commissioners voted unanimously to recommend dumping Dominion touch-screen voting machines after a pressure campaign by nationally prominent election deniers. Voting vendors also face including well-funded national campaigns targeting their machines. Such protests could gain steam nationally depending on the election outcome. Election deniers who support ending the use of electronic voting systems are campaigning in battleground states such as Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania for governor or secretary of state \u2014 the top voting administrator. Dominion declined to comment on its financial performance since the 2020 election and did not answer detailed questions about its campaign to battle misinformation. The company told Reuters that it has been \u201cactive\u201d in \u201crefuting the harmful lies spread about us.\u201d Stolen-election activists, the company said, have \u201cdamaged our company, harmed elections officials, and diminished the credibility of U.S. elections.\u201d ES&S also declined to provide financial specifics but said it has not lost customers because of the voting-machine protests. \u201cJurisdictions continue to need to seek trustworthy support of their elections,\u201d the company said in a statement. Both companies managed to grow their revenue in 2021, after the contested 2020 election, according to data provided by PrivCo, which tracks private company financial information in a proprietary database. The assault on voting machines is at the center of a broader offensive on the U.S. election system by a loose network of right-wing activists. Across the country, election officials have received hundreds of threats or menacing messages that cite debunked conspiracies involving the machines. And pro-Trump officials and activists, on the hunt for fraud evidence, have been accused of gaining or trying to gain unauthorized access to voting equipment in at least 18 security breaches since the 2020 election, Reuters has previously reported. Debunking the torrent of misinformation is costly, forcing voting-machine companies to expand investments in litigation and public relations, according to more than two dozen interviews with election officials, voting-system vendors and their representatives. Dominion has vocally rebutted voting-machine conspiracy theories in public statements and in its defamation lawsuits. But it has kept a lower profile in the local political fights over its contracts. The company said it prefers to provide information and expertise to local officials who are dealing directly with voting-machine protesters. ES&S executives travel multiple times a month to states like Kentucky, Wyoming and Idaho, where they participate in equipment demonstrations for the public, according to the company. They confront questions such as whether the machines are connected to the Internet (they aren\u2019t) and whether the company has foreign owners (it doesn\u2019t). The executives include Chris Wlaschin, the company\u2019s senior vice president and chief of security. ES&S also says it helps public information officers field questions from voters and the media even in jurisdictions where it has no business \u2014 such as Antrim County, Michigan, where a quickly corrected error in the initial reporting of 2020 results from Dominion machines was seized on by conspiracy theorists to baselessly allege widespread fraud in the state. \u201cWhen we are able to sit at that table and respond to questions, it shows that we are not hiding,\u201d Wlaschin said. Right-wing activists\u2019 nonsensical claims about systemic vote-rigging have overshadowed a more useful and long-running debate about legitimate issues with U.S. voting systems, according to four election technology experts interviewed by Reuters. Experts have long scrutinized Dominion, ES&S and other voting technology firms over issues including security, usability and interoperability, accessibility for people with disabilities, and a lack of transparency around pricing and contracts. The systems are \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d said Lindeman, of Verified Voting, but the torrent of pro-Trump vote-manipulation claims \u201cmake no sense whatsoever.\u201d Attacks on voting machines exploded after the 2020 election, led by Trump himself. He tweeted on Nov. 12, days after the election, that Dominion \u201cdeleted\u201d votes or \u201cswitched\u201d them to his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. As Trump\u2019s misinformation went viral, Denver-based Dominion faced an onslaught of Republican voter rage. Since then, false claims about Dominion and other voting-technology companies have caught fire, spread by local and national politicians, aspiring pro-Trump congressional candidates, Republican activists and right-wing media. Some have alleged without evidence that Dominion machines were rigged in plots involving Chinese communists, Venezuelan socialists or Antifa, the loosely organized U.S. anti-fascist movement. Dominion is fighting back in court. Since the 2020 election, it has filed eight defamation lawsuits against Trump allies and conservative media outlets. None has yet been resolved. The company has sued Fox News for $1.6 billion in Delaware Superior Court, alleging that Fox defamed the firm by amplifying false claims about its technology in an effort to boost ratings. In a statement to Reuters, Fox called the damages claims \"outrageous\" and \u201cnothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs.\u201d A trial is set for April 2023. To fight local political battles, Dominion arms state and county election officials with data and other information to counter conspiracy theorists. Kay Stimson, Dominion\u2019s vice president of government affairs, often calls in to local meetings when voting machine issues arise, to keep abreast of the accusations or to answer questions from officials. In Nevada, Dominion employs a high-profile consultant, former Republican Nevada governor Robert List, who appears at county meetings as the face of the company \u2013 someone who can sympathize with Trump supporters but deflect blame for his loss away from Dominion. At an April board of commissioners meeting in Elko County, for example, List told residents that he shares their \u201crural values\u201d and, as a Trump supporter himself, was disappointed in the outcome of the election. \u201cBut I know it wasn\u2019t the fault of the machines,\u201d he said, before debunking some common claims by election conspiracy theorists. Some of the highest-profile attacks on voting machines have originated with MyPillow chief executive and Trump ally Mike Lindell. In June, at a Louisiana Voting System Commission meeting, he told state officials that America will be lost \u201cif we keep even one machine in this country going forward.\u201d The commission was created by law in 2021 amid widespread claims of voter-fraud and machine-rigging in the 2020 election. The law also banned a type of voting machine that does not create an auditable paper trail, according to a September report on the effort from the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR), a nonprofit public policy organization. Lindell said in an interview that his goal in Louisiana and nationally is to force the removal of all voting and voting-counting machines and return to counting paper ballots by hand. Election officials and experts overwhelmingly reject that idea, saying the laborious process would make elections more vulnerable to fraud and error, not less. Many voting security experts recommend a middle-ground approach that already is used in the majority of U.S. jurisdictions: hand-marked ballots, completed in private by voters and counted by machines, which create a paper trail for audits or recounts. Among those calling for Louisiana to ditch Dominion machines is the state\u2019s Republican National Committeewoman, Lenar Whitney. At a Republican Party meeting last year, she described Dominion as committing \u201cillegal and treasonous acts\u201d in the 2020 election. Whitney did not respond to a request for comment. In the spring of 2021, Dominion launched a public relations campaign in Louisiana, including ads on the radio and a conservative political website, to fend off opposition to its bid for a new state contract, worth about $100 million. Its executives \u2013 along with those from other vendors \u2013 appeared at the June Voting System Commission meeting where Lindell gave his presentation attacking the machines. The executives provided technical answers to address common fears of machine skeptics \u2014 reassuring them that Dominion was U.S.-owned, and that its machines could not be remotely accessed or rigged through components imported from China. Authorities in the heavily Republican state acknowledge that their aging Dominion machines, most of them bought in 2005, are outdated. The machines Louisiana uses are no longer manufactured, requiring the state to scavenge for parts when they break and to lease some new Dominion machines as temporary replacements, according to the PAR report. The machines also do not create a paper trail for auditing, which most states now require. Nonetheless, Republican Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin last year abandoned a state effort to buy new machines amid protests from anti-machine activists and complaints about the fairness of the bidding process. The Louisiana secretary of state\u2019s office did not make Ardoin available for an interview or answer questions about the delayed contract and the pressure from stolen-election activists. The Republican state election chief, who chairs the Voting System Commission, invoked a \u201cchairman\u2019s privilege\u201d to allow Lindell more time to speak at its June meeting, where the pillow magnate addressed the board for 17 minutes. A couple of months later, on August 14, Ardoin appeared on an episode of \u201cThe Lindell Report,\u201d a show on Lindell\u2019s website. Ardoin said in the 40-minute conversation that he had sent a letter on Aug. 10 ordering local Louisiana election officials to preserve records from the 2020 election as potential fraud evidence. The secretary of state stopped short of alleging widespread voter fraud in 2020 but said a \u201ctravesty of manipulation\u201d had \u201cchanged the outcome.\u201d He referred to election law changes before the vote, which included expansions of mail voting and ballot drop boxes meant to protect voters amid the coronavirus pandemic. Asked about voting machines, Ardoin said he had told the chief executives of at least two machine suppliers that they needed to be more \u201ctransparent\u201d about the internal workings of the equipment. Otherwise, he recalled telling them, \u201cYou\u2019re going to go out of business and our Republic is going to go to hell in a handbasket.\u201d HAND-COUNTING IN NEVADA Dominion\u2019s business is also precarious in Stark County, Ohio. The local Board of Elections voted in December 2020 to replace aging Dominion machines with more than 1,400 new ones at a cost of $6.5 million. After Trump supporters protested, citing false voter-fraud claims, the county\u2019s all-Republican Board of Commissioners voted in March of 2021 to withhold funding for the machines, arguing the county could save money by using other voting-equipment vendors. The county\u2019s Board of Elections sued the commissioners in April last year to try to force them to buy the machines in time for primary elections. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in May 2021 that the elections board has authority to select voting technology, and that the county must go ahead with the purchase of Dominion machines. The county complied with the ruling. Members of the elections board and the county commission did not respond to requests for comment. In Nevada, a critical election battleground, seven county commissions have considered changing their election systems, by switching voting-equipment vendors or getting rid of the machines altogether. Five of the counties have not moved forward on the proposals, but two have started making changes. In December 2021, officials in Nevada\u2019s rural Lander County voted to switch from Dominion to ES&S \u2013 a vendor used by just one other Nevada county. A Lander County elections technology official told an October board of commissioners meeting that replacing Dominion machines was a \u201cpositive change to help regain trust in the system.\u201d County officials approved spending more than $223,000 on new ES&S equipment and an additional $69,000 for equipment installation, training and maintenance. In Nye County, where Trump won 69% of votes in 2020, commissioners voted 5-0 in March to request that the county clerk ditch Dominion touch-screen voting machines and require voters to submit paper ballots. The county plans to continue using Dominion vote-counting machines, but also to separately hand-count the ballots to confirm the result. Newly elected County Clerk Mark Kampf in September called the continued use of Dominion tabulators a \u201cstopgap measure\u201d as the county researches whether it can exclusively hand-count in the future. Commissioners were persuaded after a presentation led by Jim Marchant, a Republican candidate for Nevada Secretary of State who falsely claimed voting machines were rigged against Trump in 2020. Marchant is running in a close race and could become the state\u2019s top election official. \u201cWhy is it even a possibility we would even use any of these electronic voting machines at all?\u201d Marchant asked in a March 3 email to Nye\u2019s commission chair, obtained by Reuters in a public records request. Marchant did not respond to requests for comment. The decision by Nye\u2019s commissioners amounted to a recommendation. Only the county clerk could legally implement it. Nye\u2019s longtime Republican clerk, Sandra Merlino, said she took early retirement in August out of frustration with the move to scrap the machines. Her replacement, Kampf, has claimed Trump won the 2020 election. He moved quickly to implement the hand-counting plan. Kampf did not respond to a request for comment. Nye\u2019s move to paper ballots and its possible switch to exclusively hand-counting could cost Dominion. The company had been receiving more than $50,000 annually for maintenance and other services, according to Merlino, the former clerk. Dominion machines remain in use in 14 of Nevada\u2019s 17 counties. Merlino said she was stunned the commissioners voted for junking the machines and returning to old-fashioned hand counts. \u201cI thought: My commissioners are not going to go for this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they did.\u201d Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump": "\n Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021.\n Trump graduated from the Wharton School with a bachelor's degree in 1968. He became president of his father's real-estate business in 1971 and renamed it the Trump Organization. He expanded its operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses and later started side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six corporate bankruptcies.\n He won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote.[a] During that campaign, Trump's political positions were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist.  He was the first U.S. president with no prior military or government service. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. The 2017\u20132019 special counsel investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to favor his campaign. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist and many as misogynistic.\n As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and implemented a policy of family separations for apprehended migrants. He weakened environmental protections, rolling back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed 54 federal appellate judges and three U.S. Supreme Court justices. He initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times but made no progress on denuclearization. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments.\n Trump lost the 2020 United States presidential election to Joe Biden. He refused to concede defeat, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud, and attempted to overturn the results by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, which many of them then attacked, resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count.\n Trump is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he tried to pressure Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached in December by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress; he was acquitted by the Senate in February 2020. The House impeached him a second time in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection, and the Senate acquitted him the next month. In December 2022, the House January 6 Committee recommended criminal charges against him for obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., and inciting or assisting an insurrection. Scholars and historians rank Trump as one of the worst presidents in American history.[1][2]\n Since leaving office, Trump has remained heavily involved in the Republican Party. In November 2022, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. In March 2023, a Manhattan grand jury indicted him on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, and, in June, a federal grand jury indicted him on 37 counts related to his handling of classified documents.\n Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City,[3] the fourth child of Fred Trump, a Bronx-born real-estate developer whose parents were German immigrants, and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, an immigrant from Scotland. Trump grew up with older siblings Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth and younger brother Robert in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, and attended the private Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.[4][5][6] At age 13, he was enrolled at the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school,[7] and, in 1964, he enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics.[8][9] In 2015, Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Trump's colleges, high school, and the College Board with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.[10]\n While in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments during the Vietnam War era.[11] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968, a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve.[12] In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional medical deferment,[13] and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F due to bone spurs, permanently disqualifying him from service.[14]\n In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1.[15] They had three children: Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[16] The couple divorced in 1990, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[17] Trump and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (born 1993), who was raised by Marla in California.[18] In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[19] They have one son, Barron (born 2006).[20] Melania gained U.S. citizenship in 2006.[21]\n Trump went to Sunday school and was confirmed in 1959 at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens.[22][23] In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, which belongs to the Reformed Church in America.[22][24] The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale,[22] ministered to the family until his death in 1993.[24] Trump has described him as a mentor.[25] In 2015, the church stated that Trump was not an active member.[23] In 2019, he appointed his personal pastor, televangelist Paula White, to the White House Office of Public Liaison.[26] In 2020, he said he identified as a non-denominational Christian.[27]\n Trump has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\" but usually does not walk the course.[28] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes exercise depletes the body's energy \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\".[29] In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that Trump would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[30] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three Trump agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office.[30][31]\n In 1982, Trump made the initial Forbes list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200\u00a0million net worth (equivalent to $606\u00a0million in 2022).[32] His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[33] After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with the FEC in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10\u00a0billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4\u00a0billion in assets and $265\u00a0million in liabilities.[34] Forbes estimated his net worth dropped by $1.4 billion between 2015 and 2018.[35] In their 2021 billionaires ranking, Trump's net worth was estimated to be $2.4\u00a0billion (1,299th in the world).[36]\n Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that Trump called him in 1984, pretending to be a fictional Trump Organization official named \"John Barron\". Greenberg said that Trump, speaking as \"Barron\", falsely asserted that he owned more than 90 percent of his father's business to get a higher ranking for himself on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.[37]\n Trump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[38] He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60\u00a0million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413\u00a0million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's company.[39][40] In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance started an investigation.[40] His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets.[41][42] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5\u00a0billion in 2015 to $3.1\u00a0billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23\u00a0million to $3\u00a0million.[43]\n Contrary to his claims of financial health and business acumen, Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17\u00a0billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250\u00a0million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7\u00a0million (equivalent to $1.76\u00a0billion in 2022).[44][45][32]\n In 2020, the New York Times obtained Trump's tax information extending over two decades. Its reporters found that Trump reported losses of hundreds of millions of dollars and had, since 2010, deferred declaring $287\u00a0million in forgiven debt as taxable income. His income mainly came from his share in The Apprentice and businesses in which he was a minority partner, and his losses mainly from majority-owned businesses. Much income was in tax credits for his losses, which let him avoid annual income tax payments or lower them to $750. During the 2010s, Trump balanced his businesses' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100\u00a0million mortgage on Trump Tower (due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200\u00a0million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421\u00a0million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.[46]\n As of October 2021, Trump had over $1.3\u00a0billion in total debts, much of which is secured by his assets.[47] In 2020, he owed $640\u00a0million to banks and trust organizations, including Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, and approximately $450\u00a0million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt.[48]\n Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father Fred's real-estate company, Trump Management, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[49][50] In 1971, he became president of the company and began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[51]  Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses, the Plaza hotel, the Atlantic City casinos, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[52]\n Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[53] The financing was facilitated by a $400\u00a0million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump,[50] who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70\u00a0million in bank construction financing.[54] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[55] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[56] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[57][58]\n In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan with a loan from a consortium of banks.[59] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later.[60] In 1995, Trump sold the Plaza Hotel along with most of his properties to pay down his debts, including personally guaranteed loans, allowing him to avoid personal bankruptcy.[61][62]\n In 1996, Trump acquired the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building, and renovated it.[63] In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28\u00a0ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who were able to finance the project's completion, Riverside South.[64]\n In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[65] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[66] In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.[58]\n In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[67] It was unprofitable, and Trump paid Holiday $70\u00a0million in May 1986 to take sole control.[68] In 1985, Trump bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[69] His wife Ivana managed it until 1988.[70] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[71]\n Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675\u00a0million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1\u00a0billion, opening in April 1990.[72][73] Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, Trump gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[74] To reduce his $900\u00a0million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[75]\n In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[76] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership.[67] He remained chairman until 2009.[77]\n The Trump Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999.[78] It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.[78][79]\n Trump visited a Trump Organization property on 428 (nearly one in three) of the 1,461 days of his presidency and is estimated to have played 261 rounds of golf, one every 5.6 days.[80]\n The Trump name has been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings.[81][82] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, and they have generated at least $59\u00a0million in revenue for his companies.[83] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[81]\n In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (when they competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit against the organization.[84][85]\n Trump's businesses have hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall, adjacent to and promoted as taking place at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.[86][87] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[88]\n From 1986 to 1988, Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[44] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail.[89] The New York Times found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".[44]\n In 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380\u00a0million (equivalent to $940\u00a0million in 2022)[32] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992.[90] Trump defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[91]  The airline was eventually sold to US Airways.[90]\n In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20\u201350 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups.[40][92] The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units.[40]\n From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned all or part of the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[93][94] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[95][96] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[97] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants from their broadcasting lineups in June 2015.[98]\n In 2004, Trump co-founded Trump University, a company that sold real-estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000.[99] After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[100]\n In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40\u00a0million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[101] In addition, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[102][103][104] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, Trump agreed to pay a total of $25\u00a0million to settle the three cases.[105]\n The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[106][107] In the foundation's final years, its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014.[108] The foundation gave to health-care- and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[109]\n In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[110] Also in 2016, the New York Attorney General determined the foundation to be in violation of state law for soliciting donations and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[111] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[112]\n In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8\u00a0million in restitution and additional penalties.[113][114] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[115] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2\u00a0million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[116][117]\n Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[118] According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.[118] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the United States government for $100\u00a0million (equivalent to $659\u00a0million in 2022)[32] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case went forward, ultimately resulting in a settlement.[119] In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[120] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[121]\n According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[122] While Trump has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[123] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties.[123]\n During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4\u00a0billion.[124] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[125] After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with Trump or his company in the future.[126]\n Using ghostwriters, Trump has produced up to 19 books on business, financial, or political topics under his name.[127] His first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller. While Trump was credited as co-author, the entire book was written by Tony Schwartz.[128] According to The New Yorker, \"The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon.\"[128] Trump has called the volume his second favorite book, after the Bible.[129]\n Trump made cameo appearances in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.[130]\n Trump had a sporadic relationship with the professional wrestling promotion WWE since the late 1980s.[131] He appeared at WrestleMania 23 in 2007 and was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013.[132]\n Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[133] He also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped! (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.[134][135] From 2011 until 2015, he was a weekly unpaid guest commentator on Fox & Friends.[136][137]\n From 2004 to 2015, Trump was co-producer and host of reality shows The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice. On The Apprentice, Trump played the role of a chief executive, and contestants competed for a year of employment at the Trump Organization. On The Celebrity Apprentice, celebrities competed to win money for charities. On both shows, Trump eliminated contestants with the catchphrase \"You're fired.\"[138]\n In February 2021, Trump resigned from the Screen Actors Guild he had been a member of since 1989 rather than face a disciplinary committee hearing for inciting the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and for his \"reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists\".[139] Two days later, the union permanently barred him from readmission.[140]\n Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in 1987;[141] a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999;[142] a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[141]\n In 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers,[143] expressing his views on foreign policy and on how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[144] He ruled out running for local office but not for the presidency.[143] In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's running mate. Bush found the request \"strange and unbelievable\".[145]\n In 2000, Trump ran in the California and Michigan primaries for nomination as the Reform Party candidate for the 2000 United States presidential election but withdrew from the race in February 2000.[146][147][148] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[149]\n In 2011, Trump speculated about running against President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, making his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving speeches in early primary states.[150][151] In May 2011, he announced he would not run,[150] and he endorsed Mitt Romney in February 2012.[152] Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[153]\n Trump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[154] He adopted the phrase \"truthful hyperbole\", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style.[128][155] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[156] and a record number of them were false.[157][158][159] The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has.\"[160][161] Trump said he disdained political correctness and frequently made claims of media bias.[162][163]\n Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015.[164][165] His campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[166] He became the front-runner in March 2016[167] and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[168]\n Hillary Clinton led Trump in national polling averages throughout the campaign, but, in early July, her lead narrowed.[169][170] In mid-July Trump selected Indiana governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate,[171] and the two were officially nominated at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[172]\nTrump and Clinton faced off in three presidential debates in September and October 2016. Trump twice refused to say whether he would accept the result of the election.[173]\n Trump's political positions and rhetoric were right-wing populist.[174][175][176] Politico described them as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\", quoting a health-care policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute as saying that his political positions were \"a total random assortment of whatever plays publicly\".[177] NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[178]\n Trump questioned the need for NATO and espoused views that were described as isolationist, non-interventionist, and protectionist.[179] His campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.\u2013China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. Other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries[180] to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. He described NATO as \"obsolete\".[181][182]\n Trump helped bring far-right fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[183] Trump was slow to disavow an endorsement from David Duke after he was questioned about it during a CNN interview on February 28, 2016.[184] Duke enthusiastically supported Trump and said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to \"take our country back\".[185][186] In August 2016, Trump hired Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u2014described by Bannon as \"the platform for the alt-right\"\u2014as his campaign CEO.[187] The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[188][189][190]\n Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4\u00a0billion and outstanding debts of at least $315\u00a0million.[34][191]\nTrump did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[192][193] He said his tax returns were being audited, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[194] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the United States Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[195][196]\n In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump had declared a loss of $916\u00a0million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.[197]\n On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton, though, after elector defections on both sides, the official count was ultimately 304 to 227.[198] Trump received nearly 2.9\u00a0million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[199] Trump also became the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president.[200] \nTrump's victory was a political upset.[201] Polls had consistently shown Clinton with a nationwide\u2014though diminishing\u2014lead, as well as an advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated, while Clinton's had been overestimated.[202]\n Trump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, states which had been considered a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of an undivided Republican government\u2014a Republican White House combined with Republican control of both chambers of Congress.[203]\n Trump's election victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities in the days following the election.[204][205] On the day after Trump's inauguration, an estimated 2.6\u00a0million people worldwide, including an estimated half million in Washington, D.C., protested against Trump in the Women's Marches.[206]\n Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[207]\n Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner became his assistant and senior advisor, respectively.[208][209]\n Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and a business associate.[210][211] He continued to profit from his businesses[212] and to know how his administration's policies affected his businesses.[211] Though Trump said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic.[212]\n Trump was sued for violating the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, marking the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.[213][214] The plaintiffs said that Trump's business interests could allow foreign governments to influence him.[214][212][215][213] After Trump's term ended, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the cases as moot.[216]\n Trump took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history,[217] which began in June 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began.[218]\n In December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The bill had been passed by both Republican-controlled chambers of Congress without any Democratic votes. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025, and eliminated the penalty associated with Affordable Care Act's individual mandate.[219][220] The Trump administration claimed that the act would either increase tax revenues or pay for itself by prompting economic growth. Instead, revenues in 2018 were 7.6 percent lower than projected.[221]\n Despite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump approved large increases in government spending and the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1\u00a0trillion in 2019.[222] Under Trump, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75\u00a0trillion by the end of his term, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post-World War II high.[223] Trump also failed to deliver the $1\u00a0trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[224]\n Trump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3\u00a0million people.[217]\n Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[225][226] He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[227] In June 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[228]\n Trump aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels.[229][230] Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[231][232]\nTrump rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Trump's actions while president have been called \"a very aggressive attempt to rewrite our laws and reinterpret the meaning of environmental protections\".[233]\n In January 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, though it did not require elimination.[234] He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[235][236] labor,[237][236] and the environment,[238][236] among other topics. Trump signed 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions repealing federal regulations, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[239] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[240] often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[241] The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of Trump's proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[242]\n During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[243] In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders 13765[244] and 13813.[245] Trump expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[246][247] Trump falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA.[248] In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the ACA unconstitutional.[249][250] If they had succeeded, it would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23\u00a0million Americans.[249] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020, he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.[251]\n In response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 deaths in 2019.[252]\n Trump advocated for the reversal of Roe v. Wade. He said he supported \"traditional marriage\" but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[253] In March 2017, his administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBT people.[254]\n Trump has said he is opposed to gun control in general, although his views have shifted over time.[255] After several mass shootings during his term, he said he would propose legislation to curtail gun violence, but he abandoned that effort in November 2019.[256] His administration took an anti-marijuana position, revoking Obama-era policies that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[257]\n Trump is a long-time advocate of capital punishment.[258][259] Under his administration, the federal government executed 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined and after a 17-year moratorium.[260] In 2016, Trump said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such as waterboarding[261][262] but later appeared to recant this due to the opposition of Defense Secretary James Mattis.[263]\n Most of Trump's pardons and commutations were granted to people with personal or political connections to him.[264] In his term, Trump sidestepped regular Department of Justice procedures for considering pardons; instead, he often entertained pardon requests from his associates or celebrities.[264]\n From 2017 to 2019, he pardoned, amongst others, former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio;[265] former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of classified areas inside a submarine;[266] and right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza.[267] Following a request by celebrity Kim Kardashian, Trump commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who had been convicted of drug trafficking.[268] Trump also pardoned or reversed the sentences of three American servicemen convicted or accused of committing war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq.[269]\n In November and December 2020, Trump pardoned four Blackwater private security contractors convicted of killing Iraqi civilians in the 2007 Nisour Square massacre;[270] white-collar criminals Michael Milken and Bernard Kerik;[271] and daughter Ivanka's father-in-law Charles Kushner.[264] He also pardoned five people convicted as a result of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections: Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Alex van der Zwaan,[270] Stone, whose 40-month sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction he had already commuted in July, and Paul Manafort.[272]\n In his last full day in office, Trump granted 143 pardons and commutations. Those pardoned included Steve Bannon, Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy, and three former Republican congressmen.[b] The commuted sentences included those of former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and sports gambler Billy Walters. Walters had paid tens of thousands of dollars to former Trump attorney John M. Dowd to plead his case with Trump.[273]\n On June 1, 2020, federal law-enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House.[274][275] Trump then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church, where protesters had set a small fire the night before; he posed for photographs holding a Bible, with senior administration officials later joining him in photos.[274][276] Trump said on June 3 that the protesters were cleared because \"they tried to burn down the church [on May 31] and almost succeeded\", describing the church as \"badly hurt\".[277]\n Religious leaders condemned the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[278] Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[279]\n Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a wall on the Mexico\u2013United States border to restrict illegal movement and vowed Mexico would pay for it.[280] He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[281] and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing \"anchor babies\".[282] As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang MS-13,[283] though available research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans.[284][285]\n Trump attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.[286][287]\n From 2018 onward, Trump deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border[288] to stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum. In 2020, his administration widened the public charge rule to further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency via green cards.[289] Trump reduced the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. to record lows. When Trump took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.[290][291] Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted compared to the allowed limits.[292]\n Following the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[293] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[294]\n On January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing confusion and chaos at airports.[295][296] Protests against the ban began at airports the next day.[295][296] Legal challenges to the order resulted in nationwide preliminary injunctions.[297] A March 6 revised order, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states.[298][299] In a decision in June 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\".[300]\n The temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[301] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017,[302] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling.[303]\n The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[304][305] In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted.[306] This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors.[307] Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.[308]\n The policy of family separations was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.[308][309] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration's policy.[310][311][312]\n Although Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he accceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" doing so would pose a risk to the child.[313][314] On June 26, 2018, Judge Dana Sabraw concluded that the Trump administration had \"no system in place to keep track of\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;[315] Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.[316] After the federal-court order, the Trump administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; the ACLU contended that the Trump administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.[305]\n One of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600\u00a0km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[317] By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64\u00a0km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53\u00a0km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587\u00a0km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[318]\n In 2018, Trump refused to sign any appropriations bill from Congress unless it allocated $5.6\u00a0billion in funds for the border wall,[319] resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.[320][321] Around 800,000 government employees were furloughed or worked without pay.[322] Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall.[320] The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3\u00a0billion to the economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office.[323] About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped.[324]\n To prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a funding bill that included $1.375\u00a0billion for 55 miles (89\u00a0km) of bollard border fencing.[325] Trump also declared a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States, intending to divert $6.1\u00a0billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes.[325] Trump vetoed a joint resolution to overturn the declaration, and the Senate voted against a veto override.[326] Legal challenges to the diversion of $2.5\u00a0billion originally meant for the Department of Defense's drug interdiction efforts[327][328] and $3.6\u00a0billion originally meant for military construction[329][330] were unsuccessful.\n Trump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[331] and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[332] His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of populist, neo-nationalist and authoritarian governments.[333] Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty,[332] a lack of a consistent foreign policy,[334] and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies.[335] He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from the alliance.[336][337]\n In the 1980s, Trump publicly announced his skepticism of trade liberalization, saying, \"I believe very strongly in tariffs.\" In 2015, he sharply criticized NAFTA during the Republican primary campaign.[338][339] During his presidency, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[340] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[341] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50\u00a0billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[342] While Trump said that import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[343] Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the trade deficit in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, \"was the largest monthly deficit since July 2008\".[344] Following a 2017\u20132018 renegotiation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[345]\n The Trump administration \"water[ed] down the toughest penalties the U.S. had imposed on Russian entities\" after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.[346][347] Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian non-compliance,[348] and supported a potential return of Russia to the G7.[349]\n Trump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin[350][351] but opposed some actions of the Russian government.[352][353] After he met Putin at the Helsinki Summit in July 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies.[354][355][356] Trump did not discuss alleged Russian bounties offered to Taliban fighters for attacking American soldiers in Afghanistan with Putin, saying both that he doubted the intelligence and that he was not briefed on it.[357]\n Before and during his presidency, Trump repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.[358] As president, Trump launched a trade war against China that was widely characterized as a failure,[359][360][361] sanctioned Huawei for its alleged ties to Iran,[362] significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars,[363] and classified China as a currency manipulator.[364] Trump also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise of Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping,[365] which was attributed to trade war negotiations with the leader.[366] After initially praising China for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic,[367] he began a campaign of criticism over its response starting in March 2020.[368]\n Trump said he resisted punishing China for its human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the northwestern Xinjiang region for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations.[369] In July 2020, the Trump administration imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded mass detention camps holding more than a million of the country's Uyghur Muslim ethnic minority.[370]\n In 2017, when North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat,[371] Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".[372][373] In 2017, Trump declared that he wanted North Korea's \"complete denuclearization\", and engaged in name-calling with leader Kim Jong Un.[372][374]\n After this period of tension, Trump and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship.[375][376] Trump met Kim three times: in Singapore in 2018, in Hanoi in 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in 2019.[377] Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader or to set foot on North Korean soil.[377] Trump also lifted some U.S. sanctions against North Korea.[378]\n However, no denuclearization agreement was reached,[379] and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[380] While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.[381][382]\n U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[383] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[384] In February 2020, the Trump administration signed a conditional peace agreement with the Taliban, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000 Taliban imprisoned by the Afghan government.[385][386][387] By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating Al-Qaeda members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[387]\n Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[388] Under Trump, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel[389] and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,[390] leading to international condemnation including from the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union, and the Arab League.[391][392]\n Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian\u2013led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and in 2017 signed a $110\u00a0billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia,[393] In 2018, the USA provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention.[394][395] Following the 2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed on Iran, Trump approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, two Patriot batteries, and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.[396]\n Trump ordered missile strikes in April 2017 and in April 2018 against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun and Douma chemical attacks, respectively.[397][398]\n In December 2018, Trump declared \"we have won against ISIS\", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.[399][400] The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling his decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s Kurdish allies who played a key role in fighting ISIS.[401] One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.[402]\n In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area and Turkey invaded northern Syria, attacking and displacing American-allied Kurds in the area.[403] Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for \"abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe\".[404][405]\n After an Iranian missile test on January 29, 2017, and Houthi attacks on Saudi warships, the Trump administration sanctioned 12 companies and 13 individuals suspected of being involved in Iran's missile program.[406] In May 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program.[407][408] Analysts determined that, after the United States's withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[409]\n In January 2020, Trump ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who had planned nearly every significant operation by Iranian forces over the past two decades.[410] Trump threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites, including some \"important to Iran & the Iranian culture\", if Iran retaliated.[411] The threat to hit cultural sites was seen as illegal and both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. would not attack such sites, but would \"follow the laws of armed conflict\" and \"behave inside the system\".[412] Iran did retaliate with ballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbases in Iraq.[409] On the same day, amid the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, Iran accidentally[413] shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran airport.[414][413][415]\n In August 2020, the Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to trigger a mechanism that was part of the agreement that would have led to the return of U.N. sanctions against Iran.[416]\n The Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[417] As of early July\u00a02018[update], 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[418] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[419] Both figures set a record for recent presidents\u2014more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[420] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[420] Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee, and Keith Schiller quit or were forced out.[421] Some, including Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts.[422] Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[423]\n Trump had four White House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several.[424] Reince Priebus was replaced after seven months by retired Marine general John F. Kelly.[425] Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him.[426] Kelly was succeeded by Mick Mulvaney as acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 by Mark Meadows.[424]\n On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's roles in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[427] At a private conversation in February, Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.[428] In March and April, Trump asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.[428][429]\n Turnover was relatively high within the Trump Cabinet.[421] Trump lost tree of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year.[430] Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.[430][421] Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.[431][432]\n Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[433] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61 percent) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37 percent).[434]\n Trump appointed 226 Article III judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.[435] Trump's Supreme Court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the Supreme Court to the right.[436][437][438][439] In the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged that Roe v. Wade would be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three pro-life justices. Trump later took credit when Roe was overturned in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.[440][441][442]\n Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. Trump's attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of Trump's statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.[443][444][445]\n In December 2019, COVID-19 erupted in Wuhan, China; the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread worldwide within weeks.[446][447] The first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported on January 20, 2020.[448] The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar on January 31, 2020.[449]\n Trump's public statements on COVID-19 were at odds with his private statements. In February 2020 Trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly than influenza, was \"very much under control\", and would soon be over.[450] At the same time he acknowledged the opposite in a private conversation with Bob Woodward. In March 2020, Trump privately told Woodward that he was deliberately \"playing it down\" in public so as not to create panic.[451][452]\n Trump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[453][454] Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak, and largely ignored the danger.[455] By mid-March, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the emerging pandemic.[456]\n On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law, which provided $8.3\u00a0billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.[457] On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic,[446] and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13.[458] That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \"horrible\" but \"a temporary moment\" and saying there was no financial crisis.[459] On March 13, he declared a national emergency, freeing up federal resources.[460] Trump falsely claimed that \"anybody that wants a test can get a test\", despite the availability of tests being severely limited.[461]\n In September 2019, the Trump administration terminated United States Agency for International Development's PREDICT program, a $200\u00a0million epidemiological research program initiated in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad.[462][463] The program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. One such laboratory was the Wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes COVID-19. After revival in April 2020, the program was given two 6-month extensions to help fight COVID-19 in the U.S. and other countries.[464][465]\n On April 22, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration to the United States.[466] In late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.[467]\n Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020.[468] Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[469] sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[470] Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[469][471] On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[472] His repeated use of the terms \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[473][474][475]\n By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the World Health Organization (WHO).[476] The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[477] the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[478][479]\n In early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would \"indefinitely\" continue.[480] By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced.[481]\n Prior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[482] His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[482] In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus\" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic.[482][483][484] He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[482] Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[482][485][486] In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021.[483][484] The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\".[483][484]\n In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\".[487][488] The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[489][490] In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[491][492] The day after this political interference was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested.[492]\n In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[493][494] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[495] even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's own guidelines for reopening.[496] In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[497] Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy.[498]\n Trump often refused to wear a face mask at public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public[499] and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus.[500] By June, Trump had said masks were a \"double-edged sword\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[500] Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[499][500]\n Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are \"totally harmless\".[501][502] He also began insisting that all states should open schools to in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.[503]\n Trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[491] such as approving unproven treatments[504][505] or speeding up the approval of vaccines.[505] Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[506][507] Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[508]\n On October 2, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID-19.[509][510] His wife, their son Barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected.[511][512]\n Later that day Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to labored breathing and a fever. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October 5, still struggling with the disease.[513] During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.[511] In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case of the disease.[512]\n By July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue for the 2020 presidential election.[514] Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election.[515] Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[514] and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[516] In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths.[517] A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[518]\n After he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[519] There were 30 investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[520]\n In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. Trump then sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[521] In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[522] and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply.[523][524] Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings.[525] In September 2022, the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.[526]\n During the 2016 presidential election campaign, American Media, Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer,[527] and a company set up by Cohen paid Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[528] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump to influence the presidential election.[529] Trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017.[530][531] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[532] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[533][534] Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019,[535] but the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments[536] and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns.[537] In November 2022, The New York Times reported that Manhattan prosecutors were \"newly optimistic about building a case\" against Trump.[538]\n In January 2017, American intelligence agencies\u2014the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence\u2014jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[539][540] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[541] Many suspicious[542] links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies were discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\" were widely reported by the press.[543][544]\n Manafort, one of Trump's campaign managers, worked from December 2004 to February 2010 to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency.[545] Other Trump associates, including Flynn and Stone, were connected to Russian officials.[546][547] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[548] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[549][550] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.[551] Trump told Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[552]\n Trump and his allies promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election\u2014which was also promoted by Russia to frame Ukraine.[553] After the Democratic National Committee was hacked, Trump first claimed it withheld \"its server\" from the FBI (in actuality there were more than 140 servers, of which digital copies were given to the FBI); second, that CrowdStrike, the company that investigated the servers, was Ukraine-based and Ukrainian-owned (in actuality, CrowdStrike is U.S.-based, with the largest owners being American companies); and third that \"the server\" was hidden in Ukraine. Members of the Trump administration spoke out against the conspiracy theories.[554]\n In July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamed Crossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[555] After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia.[556] Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[557] but deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ended the investigation into Trump's direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that Mueller would pursue the matter.[558][559]\n In May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, special counsel for the Department of Justice (DOJ), ordering him to \"examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the Trump campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference\".[558] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[560] and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[561] Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[562]\n In March 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr.[563] Two days later, Barr sent a letter to Congress purporting to summarize the report's main conclusions. A federal court, as well as Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation's conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.[564][565][566] Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not exonerate him.[567]\n A redacted version of the report was publicly released in April 2019. It found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's.[568] Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the report found that the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[569][570] The report revealed sweeping Russian interference[570] and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing \"[they] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\".[571][572][573][574]\n The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not make a \"traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on whether Trump broke the law, suggesting that Congress should make such a determination.[575][576] Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\" as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,[577] and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[578] The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[577] The House of Representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[579][580]\n Several Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller's investigation and related cases, including Manafort, convicted on eight felony counts,[581] deputy campaign manager Rick Gates,[582] foreign policy advisor Papadopoulos,[583] and Flynn.[584][585] Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as \"Individual-1\" in the court documents.[586] In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering regarding his attempts to learn more about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 election. The sentencing judge said Stone \"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\".[587]\n In August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter, adding that the White House had attempted to cover-up the incident.[588] The whistleblower stated that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.[589]\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[590] Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.[591][592] On September 25, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.[588][593] The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[594] In October, William B. Taylor Jr., the charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment investigating the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[595] He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.[596]\n On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress.[597] After debate, the House of Representatives impeached Trump on both articles on December 18.[598]\n During the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers presented their case for three days. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution's impeachment process.[599]\nResponding over the next three days, Trump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[600] They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[600]\n On January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents; 51 Republicans formed the majority for this vote.[601] The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.[602]\n Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority, 52\u201348 on abuse of power and 53\u201347 on obstruction of Congress. Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict Trump on one charge, the abuse of power.[603] Following his acquittal, Trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.[604]\n Breaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[605] He held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office[606] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.[607]\n In his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5\u00a0million and began 2019 with $19.3\u00a0million in cash.[608] By July 2020, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1\u00a0billion and spent $800\u00a0million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.[609] The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.[610]\n Trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won the presidency.[611] Trump repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions[612][613] and shifted to appeals to racism.[614]\n Starting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[615][616] In July, Trump raised the idea of delaying the election.[617] When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25\u00a0billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[618] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.[619][620]\n Biden won the election on November 3, receiving 81.3\u00a0million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2\u00a0million (46.8 percent)[621][622] and 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.[623]\n At 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[624] After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump said, \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[625] Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[626][627] Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials.[628] After Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17.[629] On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from the Texas attorney general that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[630]\n Trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.[631] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition.[632][633] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[634] Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.[635][636]\n The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14.[623] From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results of the election, personally pressuring various Republican local and state office-holders,[637] Republican state and federal legislators,[638] the Justice Department,[639] and Vice President Pence,[640] urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result.[638] On February 10, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.[641]\n Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration, leaving Washington for Florida hours before.[642]\n In December 2020, Newsweek reported the Pentagon was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if Trump decided to declare martial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of elections.[643]\n When Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and CIA director Gina Haspel became concerned about the threat of a possible coup attempt or military action against China or Iran.[644][645] Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed Haspel and NSA director Paul Nakasone to monitor developments closely.[646][647]\n On January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the United States Capitol, Trump held a noon rally at the Ellipse, Washington, D.C.. He called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol to \"show strength\" and \"fight like hell\".[648][649] Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. Around 2:15\u00a0p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[650] During the violence, Trump watched TV and posted messages on Twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. At 6\u00a0p.m., Trump tweeted that the rioters should \"go home with love & in peace\", calling them \"great patriots\" and \"very special\" and repeating that the election was stolen from him.[651] After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning.[652] According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died.[653][654]\n More than 1,000 people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack.[655] In March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a song to benefit the prisoners, and, in June, he said that, if elected, he would pardon a large number of them.[656]\n On January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection against the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[657] The House voted 232\u2013197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[658] Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment\u2014the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[659]\n On February 13, following a five-day Senate trial, Trump was acquitted when the Senate voted 57\u201343 for conviction, falling ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.[660][661] Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January 20; the Senate voted 56\u201344 the trial was constitutional).[662] Included in the latter group was McConnell, who said Trump was \"practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day\", but \"constitutionally not eligible for conviction\".[663]\n At the end of his term, Trump went to live at his Mar-a-Lago club.[664] As provided for by the Former Presidents Act,[665] he established an office there to handle his post-presidential activities.[665][666]\n Trump's false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \"big lie\" in the press and by his critics. In May 2021, Trump and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself.[667][668] The Republican Party used Trump's false election narrative to justify the imposition of new voting restrictions in its favor.[668][669] As late as July 2022, Trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election by rescinding the state's electoral votes for Biden.[670]\n Trump resumed his campaign-style rallies with an 85-minute speech at the annual North Carolina Republican Party convention on June 6, 2021.[671][672] On June 26, he held his first public rally since the January 6 rally that preceded the riot at the Capitol.[673]\n Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; he has been compared to a modern-day party boss. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, hinted at a third candidacy, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on the people in charge of elections and how elections are run. In the 2022 midterm elections he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices, most of whom supported his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.[674][675][676] Though there were exceptions, Trump's endorsement was seen as important for candidates in Republican primary elections.[675]\n Trump registered a new company in February 2021. Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) was formed for providing \"social networking services\" to \"customers in the United States\".[677][678] In October 2021, Trump announced the planned merger of TMTG with Digital World Acquisition,[679] a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). A main backer of the SPAC is China-based financier ARC Group, who was reportedly involved in setting up the proposed merger. The transaction is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[680][681]\n In February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social, a Twitter-like social-media platform.[682] As of March 2023, Trump Media, which had taken $8\u00a0million from Russia-connected entities, was being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible money laundering.[683][684]\n Trump is the subject of several probes into his business dealings and his actions both before and during the presidency.[685] In February 2021, the district attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, Fani Willis, announced a criminal probe into Trump's phone calls to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.[686] The New York State Attorney General's Office is conducting criminal investigations into Trump's business activities in conjunction with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.[687] By May 2021, a special grand jury was considering indictments.[688][689] In July 2021, New York prosecutors charged the Trump Organization with a \"15 year 'scheme to defraud' the government\".[690] In January 2023, the organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, was sentenced to five months in jail and five years probation for tax fraud after a plea deal.[691]\n In December 2021, the New York State Attorney General's office subpoenaed Trump to produce documents related to the business.[692] On April 25, 2022, New York state judge Arthur Engoron held Trump in contempt of court for failing to comply with the subpoena. He imposed a fine of $10,000 per day until he complies.[693] Trump was deposed in August and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times.[694] In September 2022, the Attorney General of New York filed a civil fraud case against Trump, his three oldest children, and the Trump Organization.[695]\n When Trump left the White House in January 2021, he took government documents and material with him to Mar-a-Lago. By May 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the federal agency that preserves government records, realized that important documents had not been turned over to them at the end of Trump's term and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA later informed the Department of Justice that some of the retrieved documents were classified material.[696] The Justice Department began an investigation in April 2022 and convened a grand jury.[697] The Justice Department sent Trump a subpoena for additional material on May 11.[696] On June 3, Justice Department officials visited Mar-a-Lago and received some classified documents from Trump's lawyers.[696] One of the lawyers signed a statement affirming that all material marked as classified had been returned to the government.[698] Later that month an additional subpoena was sent requesting surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, which was provided.[696][699][700]\n On August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Trump's residence, office, and storage areas at Mar-a-Lago to recover government documents and material Trump had taken with him when he left office in violation of the Presidential Records Act,[701][702] reportedly including some related to nuclear weapons.[700] The search warrant, authorized by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and approved by a federal magistrate judge, and the written inventory of the seized items were made public on August 12. The text of the search warrant indicates an investigation of potential violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice laws.[703] The items taken in the search included 11 sets of classified documents, four of them tagged as \"top secret\" and one as \"top secret/SCI\", the highest level of classification.[701][702]\n On November 18, 2022, Garland appointed a special counsel, federal prosecutor Jack Smith, to oversee the federal criminal investigations into Trump retaining government property at Mar-a-Lago and examining Trump's role in the events leading up to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.[704][705]\n On December 19, 2022, the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack recommended criminal charges against Trump for obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting or assisting an insurrection.[706]\n On November 15, 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 United States presidential election and set up a fundraising account.[707][708]\n In March 2023, a New York grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.[709][710] On April 4, he surrendered and was arrested and arraigned; he pleaded not guilty on all counts and was released. The judge scheduled the next in-person hearing for December 4; Trump has until August 8 to file any motions in the case.[711]\n On June 8, the Justice Department indicted Trump in Miami federal court for 31 counts of \"willfully retaining national defense information under the Espionage Act\", one count of making false statements, and, jointly with a personal aide, single counts of conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding government documents, corruptly concealing records, concealing a document in a federal investigation and scheming to conceal their efforts. The case was assigned to Judge Aileen M. Cannon.[712] Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.[713]\n Trump was the only president to never reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938. His approval ratings showed a record-high partisan gap: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.[714] Until September 2020, the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of 49 percent and a low of 35 percent.[715] Trump finished his term with an approval rating between 29 percent and 34 percent\u2014the lowest of any president since modern polling began\u2014and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency.[714][716]\n In Gallup's annual poll asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for most admired man in 2019, and was named most admired in 2020.[717][718] Since Gallup started conducting the poll in 1948, Trump is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.[719]\n A Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between the years 2016 and 2017 found that Trump led Obama in job approval in only 29 countries, most of them non-democracies;[720] approval of U.S. leadership plummeted among allies and G7 countries. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the George W. Bush presidency.[721] By mid-2020, only 16 percent of international respondents to a 13-nation Pew Research poll expressed confidence in Trump, a lower score than those historically accorded to Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.[722]\n C-SPAN, which has surveyed presidential historians on presidential leadership each time the administration changed since 2000,[723] ranked Trump fourth\u2013lowest overall in their Presidential Historians Survey 2021, with Trump rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.[724][725][1] The Siena College Research Institute (SCRI) has surveyed presidential scholars during the second year of the first term of each president since 1982. For the second time, SCRI ranked Trump third-lowest overall. He was ranked last on background, integrity, intelligence, foreign policy accomplishments, and executive appointments, and second to last on ability to compromise, executive ability, and present overall view. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership.[2]\n Trump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He tweeted frequently during the 2016 election campaign and as president until Twitter banned him in the final days of his term.[726] Over twelve years, Trump posted around 57,000 tweets, often using Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public and sidelining the press.[727] In June 2017, a White House press secretary said that Trump's tweets were official presidential statements.[728] Trump often announced terminations of administration officials and cabinet members over Twitter.[729]\n After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checking warnings in May 2020.[730] In response, Trump tweeted that \"Social Media Platforms totally silence conservative[] voices\" and that he would \"strongly regulate[] or close them down\".[731] In the days after the storming of the United States Capitol, Trump was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms.[732] The loss of Trump's social media presence, including his 88.7\u00a0million Twitter followers, diminished his ability to shape events,[733][734] and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter.[735] Trump's early attempts to re-establish a social media presence were unsuccessful.[736] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[737]\n On November 19, 2022, Twitter owner Elon Musk reinstated Trump's account. Trump had said that he would stay on Truth Social.[738]\n Trump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love\u2013hate\" relationship with the press.[739] In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[154] The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV.\"[740]\n As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[741] In 2018, journalist Lesley Stahl recounted Trump's saying he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[742]\n As president, Trump privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.[743] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[744] In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump.[745] The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[744]\n Trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.[746] In early 2020, the Trump campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference.[747][748] Legal experts said that the lawsuits lacked merit and were not likely to succeed.[746][749] By March 2021, the lawsuits against The New York Times and CNN had been dismissed.[750][751]\n As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks[161][157] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[755][756] His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.[755]\n Trump's false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied a total of 30,573 false or misleading statements made by Trump over his four-year term.[752] Trump's falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about six false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to 16 per day in his second year, 22 per day in his third year, and 39 per day in his final year.[757] He reached 10,000 false or misleading claims 27 months into his term; 20,000 false or misleading claims 14 months later, and 30,000 false or misleading claims five months later.[757]\n Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his claim of the \"biggest inaugural crowd ever\".[758][759] Others had more far-reaching effects, such as his promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19 in a press conference and on Twitter.[760][761] The claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the United States and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[762][763] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served Trump's domestic political purposes.[764] As a matter of principle, Trump does not apologize for his falsehoods.[765]\n Despite the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, the media rarely referred to them as lies.[766][767] The first time The Washington Post did so was in August 2018, when it declared that some of Trump's misstatements, in particular those concerning hush money paid to Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, were lies.[768][767]\n In 2020, Trump was a significant source of disinformation on mail-in voting and misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic.[769][770] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices served to weaken public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,[771][772] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.[454][769]\n James Pfiffner, professor of policy and government at George Mason University, wrote in 2019 that Trump lies differently from previous presidents, because he offers \"egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well-known facts\"; these lies are the \"most important\" of all Trump lies. By calling facts into question, people will be unable to properly evaluate their government, with beliefs or policy irrationally settled by \"political power\"; this erodes liberal democracy, wrote Pfiffner.[773]\n Before and throughout his presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama birtherism, the Clinton body count conspiracy theory, QAnon, the Global warming hoax theory, Trump Tower wiretapping allegations, a John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory involving Rafael Cruz, linking talk show host Joe Scarborough to the death of a staffer,[774] alleged foul-play in the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections, and that Osama bin Laden was alive and Obama and Biden had members of Navy SEAL Team 6 killed.[775][776][777][778][779] In at least two instances, Trump clarified to press that he also believed the conspiracy theory in question.[777]\n During and since the 2020 presidential election, Trump has promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat including dead people voting,[780] voting machines changing or deleting Trump votes, fraudulent mail-in voting, throwing out Trump votes, and \"finding\" suitcases full of Biden votes.[781][782]\n Many of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist.[783][784] In national polling, about half of respondents said that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[785][786] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[787][788] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[789]\n In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[49] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. As of 2019, he maintained this position.[790]\n In 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, he became the leading proponent of the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.[791][792] In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him \"very popular\".[793][794] In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[795] In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views in private.[796]\n According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist appeals to whites\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[797] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\".[798][799] His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding Trump University were also criticized as racist.[800]\n Trump's comments on the 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, condemning \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" and stating that there were \"very fine people on both sides\", were widely criticized as implying a moral equivalence between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counter-protesters.[801][802][803][804]\n In a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[805] His remarks were condemned as racist.[806][807]\n In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen\u2014all minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans\u2014should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[808] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240\u2013187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[809] White nationalist publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[810] Trump continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[811]\n Trump has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to media and on social media.[812][813] He made lewd comments, demeaned women's looks, and called them names, such as \"dog\", \"crazed\", \"crying lowlife\", \"face of a pig\", or \"horseface\".[813][814][815]\n In October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying, \"When you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything .... Grab 'em by the pussy.\"[816] The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign[817] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[818]\n At least 26 women have publicly accused Trump of rape, kissing, and groping without consent; looking under women's skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.[819][820][821] In 2016, he denied all such accusations, calling them \"false smears\" and alleging a conspiracy against him and the American people.[822]\n Research suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes.[823][824] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[825][826] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence.[827][828] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against members of minority groups.[829]\n Trump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature on television, in films, and in comics. He has been named in hundreds of hip hop songs since the 1980s\u2014until 2015, most of these references cast Trump in a positive light, but they turned largely negative after he began running for office.[830]\n",

Donald John Trump was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946. His father, Fred Trump was a successful real estate developer. Trump was educated at the New York Military Academy and the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1971, he took over his father\u2019s real estate company, renaming it the Trump Organization. The business soon became involved in variety of projects, including hotels, resorts, residential and commercial building, casinos, and golf courses. His first of many books was\u00a0The Art of the Deal, published in 1987. In 2004, he launched the reality television show\u00a0The Apprentice. In 2005, Donald Trump married Melania Knauss. They have one son, Barron. Trump also has four adult children from previous marriages: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany. During the 2016 primary, Trump defeated more than a dozen rivals to win the Republican nomination. While he lost the popular vote, Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the general election by winning a majority of Electoral College votes. His campaign slogan was \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Without previous elected political experience, President Trump used unconventional methods to communicate his priorities. Most notably, he used the social media platform Twitter as a primary mechanism for direct communication with the American public, other politicians, and the press corps. As president, he signed a major tax reform bill into law and oversaw a reduction of federal regulations. His protectionist trade policies included tariffs in foreign aluminum, steel, and other products. The Trump administration also renegotiated trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea. Other domestic priorities included Supreme Court and federal judiciary appointments, increased military budgets, aggressive border and immigration control, criminal justice reform, and the reduction of prescription drug prices. In foreign policy, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and brokered normalization agreements between Israel and a number of countries. In 2018, President Trump attended a summit with Kim Jong Un, marking the first time a sitting president met with a North Korean leader. In 2018, there was a partial government shutdown as Trump disagreed with Congress over funding for a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The funding lapse lasted thirty-five days before it was resolved. In 2019, a federal whistleblower filed a complaint that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who had served on the board of Bursima Holdings, a natural gas company in Ukraine. Later that year, the House of Representatives impeached President Trump based upon allegations of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. In 2020, the Senate acquitted Trump on both articles of impeachment. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the United States on January 20, 2020. The remainder of Trump\u2019s presidency was consumed with the coronavirus pandemic. Critics argued that Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic was delayed and did not sufficiently encourage public health practices to reduce the spread of the virus. However, the Trump administration\u2019s program \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d assisted in the private sector development of two approved vaccines. Nonetheless, by the time Trump left office, more than 400,000 Americans had died of COVID-19. Trump lost reelection to Democratic candidate Joe Biden, but publicly claimed widespread voter fraud had affected the outcome. Supporters of President Trump traveled to Washington, D.C. for a \u201cSave America\u201d rally on January 6, 2021. Trump spoke to the large crowd on the Ellipse near the White House and encouraged attendees to protest the counting of the Electoral College votes in Congress. The rally turned violent when the president\u2019s supporters overwhelmed law enforcement, breaching the United States Capitol and disrupting the vote count. Five people died as a result of the violence, and the Capitol complex suffered millions of dollars in damage. On January 13, 2021, Trump\u2019s actions resulted in the House of Representatives approving another article of impeachment: the incitement of insurrection. He is the only president in American history to be impeached twice by Congress. Learn more about Donald Trump\u2019s spouse, Melania Trump.

    "https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-ballot-return-internet-voting": "Thirty-one states, Washington, D.C., and the Virgin Islands allow certain voters\u2014typically military or overseas voters, or voters with disabilities\u2014to return voted absentee/mail ballots electronically, via fax (which can be sent over the phone or the internet), email or online portal. More states allow certain voters to receive blank absentee/mail ballots electronically, and then print that ballot to return it by mail or in person. No state, however, has plans now or in the near future to conduct elections entirely via the internet. Electronic Delivery of Blank Ballots:\u00a0The federal Military and Overseas Voters Empowerment Act (MOVE), passed in 2009, requires states to electronically provide blank absentee ballots to voters who fall under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). These voters\u2014often known as UOCAVA voters\u2014must be provided blank ballots in at least one electronic format\u2014email, fax\u00a0or an online delivery system\u2014at least 45 days before an election. Details on which electronic delivery formats states make available to voters can be found on the Federal Voting Assistance Program's\u00a0Voting Assistance Guide.\u00a0UOCAVA voters from any state can also vote by using an online Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot offered by the Federal Voting Assistance Program. The \u201cFWAB\u201d\u00a0is intended as a back-up ballot for voters who do not receive a ballot from their state. It can be marked electronically using FVAP's online ballot marking tool, then printed, signed\u00a0and returned to the appropriate stateside local election office. Electronic Return of Voted Absentee Ballots:\u00a0The MOVE Act does not require states to\u00a0 accept voted ballots electronically. Returning ballots by mail continues to be the default option, and in 19\u00a0states it is the only option. UOCAVA Voters:\u00a0Returning ballots electronically is most often reserved for UOCAVA voters. These voters can face unique challenges in receiving and returning absentee/mail ballots by state deadlines. Imagine, for instances, the difficulty of returning a voted absentee/mail ballot from a remote military base overseas. Over half of the states offer electronic ballot return options to UOCAVA voters, and many provide more than one option. \u00a0 Voters with Disabilities:\u00a0Thirteen states have extended electronic ballot return options to voters with disabilities, who may face unique challenges in voting in person or by mail. Others:\u00a0A few states allow electronic ballot return\u00a0in other limited circumstances, such as during certain emergencies or natural disasters (Colorado) or for qualified first responders (Utah). In Louisiana, all absentee voters have the option of returning a voted absentee ballot by fax (note that in Louisiana, voters must provide a qualifying excuse to vote an absentee ballot).

The benefits of timeliness and convenience, however, must be balanced by other considerations\u2014especially security and privacy. Eight\u00a0Republican-controlled states so far have cut ties with the Electronic Registration Information Center, a multistate consortium that helps ensure accurate voter rolls, citing unfounded concerns over privacy and transparency. The Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) has recently become the center of discussion in election administration as states consider whether to join, leave or remain.

    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting": "\n \n Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic means to either aid or take care of casting and counting ballots.\n Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic voting machines (also called EVM) or computers connected to the Internet (online voting).  It may encompass a range of Internet services, from basic transmission of tabulated results to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. The degree of automation may be limited to marking a paper ballot, or may be a comprehensive system of vote input, vote recording, data encryption and transmission to servers, and consolidation and tabulation of election results.\n A worthy e-voting system must perform most of these tasks while complying with a set of standards established by regulatory bodies, and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong requirements associated with security, accuracy, integrity, swiftness, privacy, auditability, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability and ecological sustainability.\n Electronic voting technology can include punched cards, optical scan voting systems and specialized voting kiosks (including self-contained direct-recording electronic voting systems, or DRE). It can also involve transmission of ballots and votes via telephones, private computer networks, or the Internet.\n In general, two main types of e-voting can be identified:\n Electronic voting technology intends to speed the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of paying staff to count votes manually and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters. Also in the long term, expenses are expected to decrease.[6]\nResults can be reported and published faster.[7]\nVoters save time and cost by being able to vote independently from their location. This may increase overall voter turnout. The citizen groups benefiting most from electronic elections are the ones living abroad, citizens living in rural areas far away from polling stations and the disabled with mobility impairments.[8][6]\n It has been demonstrated that as voting systems become more complex and include software, different methods of election fraud become possible. Others also challenge the use of electronic voting from a theoretical point of view, arguing that humans are not equipped for verifying operations occurring within an electronic machine and that because people cannot verify these operations, the operations cannot be trusted. Furthermore, some computing experts have argued for the broader notion that people cannot trust any programming they did not author.[9]\n The use of electronic voting in elections remains a contentious issue. Some countries such as Netherlands and Germany have stopped using it after it was shown to be unreliable, while the Indian Election commission recommends it. The involvement of numerous stakeholders including companies that manufacture these machines as well as political parties that stand to gain from rigging complicates this further.[10]\n Critics of electronic voting, including security analyst Bruce Schneier, note that \"computer security experts are unanimous on what to do (some voting experts disagree, but it is the computer security experts who need to be listened to; the problems here are with the computer, not with the fact that the computer is being used in a voting application)... DRE machines must have a voter-verifiable paper audit trails... Software used on DRE machines must be open to public scrutiny\"[11] to ensure the accuracy of the voting system.  Verifiable ballots are necessary because computers can and do malfunction, and because voting machines can be compromised.\n Many insecurities have been found in commercial voting machines, such as using a default administration password.[12][13] Cases have also been reported of machines making unpredictable, inconsistent errors. Key issues with electronic voting are therefore the openness of a system to public examination from outside experts, the creation of an authenticatable paper record of votes cast and a chain of custody for records.[14][15] And, there is a risk that commercial voting machines results are changed by the company providing the machine. There is no guarantee that results are collected and reported accurately.[6]\n There has been contention, especially in the United States, that electronic voting, especially DRE voting, could facilitate electoral fraud and may not be fully auditable. In addition, electronic voting has been criticised as unnecessary and expensive to introduce. While countries like India continue to use electronic voting, several countries have cancelled e-voting systems or decided against a large-scale rollout, notably the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and the United Kingdom due to issues in reliability of EVMs.[16][17]\n Moreover, people without internet access and/or the skills to use it are excluded from the service. The so-called digital divide describes the gap between those who have access to the internet and those who do not. Depending on the country or even regions in a country the gap differs. This concern is expected to become less important in future since the number of internet users tends to increase.[18]\n The main psychological issue is trust. Voters fear that their vote could be changed by a virus on their PC or during transmission to governmental servers.[19]\n Expenses for the installation of an electronic voting system are high. For some governments they may be too high so that they do not invest. This aspect is even more important if it is not sure whether electronic voting is a long-term solution.[6]\n During the 2021 NSW Local Government Elections the online voting system \"iVote\" had technical issues that caused some access problems for some voters. Analysis done of these failures indicated a significant chance of the outages having impacted on the electoral results for the final positions. In the Kempsey ward, where the margin between the last elected and first non-elected candidates was only 69 votes, the electoral commission determined that the outage caused a 60% chance that the wrong final candidate was elected. Singleton had a 40% chance of having elected the wrong councillor, Shellharbour was a 7% chance and two other races were impacted by a sub-1% chance of having elected the wrong candidate. The NSW Supreme Court ordered the elections in Kempsey, Singleton and Shellharbour Ward A to be re-run. In the 2022 Kempsey re-vote the highest placed non-elected candidate from 2021, Dean Saul, was instead one the first councillors elected.[20] This failure caused the NSW Government to suspend the iVote system from use in the 2023 New South Wales state election.\n Electronic voting systems for electorates have been in use since the 1960s when punched card systems debuted. Their first widespread use was in the US where 7 counties switched to this method for the 1964 presidential election.[21] The newer optical scan voting systems allow a computer to count a voter's mark on a ballot. DRE voting machines which collect and tabulate votes in a single machine, are used by all voters in all elections in Brazil and India, and also on a large scale in Venezuela and the United States. They have been used on a large scale in the Netherlands but have been decommissioned after public concerns.[22] In Brazil, the use of DRE voting machines has been associated with a decrease error-ridden and uncounted votes, promoting a larger enfranchisement of mainly less educated people in the electoral process, shifting government spending toward public healthcare, particularly beneficial to the poor.[23]\n Paper-based voting systems originated as a system where votes are cast and counted by hand, using paper ballots. With the advent of electronic tabulation came systems where paper cards or sheets could be marked by hand, but counted electronically. These systems included punched card voting, marksense and later digital pen voting systems.[24]\n These systems can include a ballot marking device or electronic ballot marker that allows voters to make their selections using an electronic input device, usually a touch screen system similar to a DRE. Systems including a ballot marking device can incorporate different forms of assistive technology. In 2004, Open Voting Consortium demonstrated the 'Dechert Design', a General Public License open source paper ballot printing system with open source bar codes on each ballot.[25]\n A direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machine records votes by means of a ballot display provided with mechanical or electro-optical components that can be activated by the voter (typically buttons or a touchscreen); that processes data with computer software; and that records voting data and ballot images in memory components. After the election it produces a tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as a printed copy. The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location. These systems use a precinct count method that tabulates ballots at the polling place. They typically tabulate ballots as they are cast and print the results after the close of polling.[26]\n In 2002, in the United States, the Help America Vote Act mandated that one handicapped accessible voting system be provided per polling place, which most jurisdictions have chosen to satisfy with the use of DRE voting machines, some switching entirely over to DRE. In 2004, 28.9% of the registered voters in the United States used some type of direct recording electronic voting system,[27] up from 7.7% in 1996.[28]\n In 2004, India adopted Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) for its elections to its parliament with 380 million voters casting their ballots using more than one million voting machines.[29] The Indian EVMs are designed and developed by two government-owned defence equipment manufacturing units, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL). Both systems are identical, and are developed to the specifications of Election Commission of India. The system is a set of two devices running on 7.5 volt batteries. One device, the voting Unit is used by the voter, and another device called the control unit is operated by the electoral officer. Both units are connected by a five-metre cable. The voting unit has a blue button for each candidate. The unit can hold 16 candidates, but up to four units can be chained, to accommodate 64 candidates. The control unit has three buttons on the surface \u2013 one button to release a single vote, one button to see the total number of votes cast till now, and one button to close the election process. The result button is hidden and sealed. It cannot be pressed unless the close button has already been pressed. A controversy was raised when the voting machine malfunctioned which was shown in Delhi assembly.[30] On 9 April 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the ECI to increase voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) slips vote count to five randomly selected EVMs per assembly constituency, which means ECI has to count VVPAT slips of 20,625 EVMs before it certifies the final election results.[31][32][33]\n A public network DRE voting system is an election system that uses electronic ballots and transmits vote data from the polling place to another location over a public network.[34] Vote data may be transmitted as individual ballots as they are cast, periodically as batches of ballots throughout the election day, or as one batch at the close of voting. \nPublic network DRE voting system can utilize either precinct count or central count method. The central count method tabulates ballots from multiple precincts at a central location.\n Internet voting systems have gained popularity and have been used for government and membership organization elections and referendums in Estonia, and Switzerland[35] as well as municipal elections in Canada and party primary elections in the United States and France.[36] Internet voting has also been widely used in sub-national participatory budgeting processes, including in Brazil, France, United States, Portugal and Spain.[37][38][39][40][41][42]\n Security experts have found security problems in every attempt at online voting,[43][44][45][46] including systems in Australia,[47][48] Estonia,[49][50] Switzerland,[51][52] Russia,[53][54][55] and the United States.[56][43]\n It has been argued political parties that have more support from the less fortunate\u2014who are unfamiliar with the Internet\u2014may suffer in the elections due to e-voting, which tends to increase voting in the upper/middle class. It is unsure as to whether narrowing the digital divide would promote equal voting opportunities for people across various social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds. In the long run, this is contingent not only on internet accessibility but also depends on people's level of familiarity with the Internet.[57]\n The effects of internet voting on overall voter turnout are unclear. A 2017 study of online voting in two Swiss cantons found that it had no effect on turnout,[58] and a 2009 study of Estonia's national election found similar results.[59] To the contrary, however, the introduction of online voting in municipal elections in the Canadian province of Ontario resulted in an average increase in turnout of around 3.5 percentage points.[60] Similarly, a further study of the Swiss case found that while online voting did not increase overall turnout, it did induce some occasional voters to participate who would have abstained were online voting not an option.[61]\n A paper on \u201cremote electronic voting and turnout in the Estonian 2007 parliamentary elections\u201d showed that rather than eliminating inequalities, e-voting might have enhanced the digital divide between higher and lower socioeconomic classes. People who lived greater distances from polling areas voted at higher levels with this service now available. The 2007 Estonian elections yielded a higher voter turnout from those who lived in higher income regions and who received formal education.[57] Still regarding the Estonian Internet voting system, it was proved to be more cost-efficient than the rest of the voting systems offered in 2017 local elections.[62][63]\n Electronic voting is perceived to be favored moreover by a certain demographic, namely the younger generation such as Generation X and Y voters. However, in recent elections about a quarter of e-votes were cast by the older demographic, such as individuals over the age of 55. Including this, about 20% of e-votes came from voters between the ages of 45 and 54. This goes to show that e-voting is not supported exclusively by the younger generations, but finding some popularity amongst Gen X and Baby Boomers as well.[65] In terms of electoral results as well, the expectation that online voting would favor younger candidates has not been borne out in the data, with mayors in Ontario, Canada who were elected in online elections actually being slightly older on average than those elected by pencil and paper.[66]\n Online voting is widely used privately for shareholder votes,[67][68] \nand other private organizations.[69][70]\nThe election management companies do not promise accuracy or privacy.[71][72][73]\nIn fact one company uses an individual's past votes for research,[74] and to target ads.[75]\n Corporations and organizations routinely use Internet voting to elect officers and board members and for other proxy elections. Internet voting systems have been used privately in many modern nations and publicly in the United States, the UK, Switzerland and Estonia. In Switzerland, where it is already an established part of local referendums, voters get their passwords to access the ballot through the postal service. Most voters in Estonia can cast their vote in local and parliamentary elections, if they want to, via the Internet, as most of those on the electoral roll have access to an e-voting system, the largest run by any European Union country. It has been made possible because most Estonians carry a national identity card equipped with a computer-readable microchip and it is these cards which they use to get access to the online ballot. All a voter needs is a computer, an electronic card reader, their ID card and its PIN, and they can vote from anywhere in the world. Estonian e-votes can only be cast during the days of advance voting. On election day itself people have to go to polling stations and fill in a paper ballot.\n There are also hybrid systems that include an electronic ballot marking device (usually a touch screen system similar to a DRE) or other assistive technology to print a voter verified paper audit trail, then use a separate machine for electronic tabulation. Hybrid voting often includes both e-voting and mail-in paper ballots. [76]\n Internet voting can use remote locations (voting from any Internet capable computer) or can use traditional polling locations with voting booths consisting of Internet connected voting systems.\n Electronic voting systems may offer advantages compared to other voting techniques. An electronic voting system can be involved in any one of a number of steps in the setup, distributing, voting, collecting, and counting of ballots, and thus may or may not introduce advantages into any of these steps. Potential disadvantages exist as well including the potential for flaws or weakness in any electronic component.\n Charles Stewart of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that 1 million more ballots were counted in the 2004 US presidential election than in 2000 because electronic voting machines detected votes that paper-based machines would have missed.[77]\n In May 2004 the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report titled \"Electronic Voting Offers Opportunities and Presents Challenges\",[78] analyzing both the benefits and concerns created by electronic voting. A second report was released in September 2005 detailing some of the concerns with electronic voting, and ongoing improvements, titled \"Federal Efforts to Improve Security and Reliability of Electronic Voting Systems Are Under Way, but Key Activities Need to Be Completed\".[79]\n Electronic voting systems may use electronic ballot to store votes in computer memory. Systems which use them exclusively are called DRE voting systems. When electronic ballots are used there is no risk of exhausting the supply of ballots.  Additionally, these electronic ballots remove the need for printing of paper ballots, a significant cost.[80] When administering elections in which ballots are offered in multiple languages (in some areas of the United States, public elections are required by the National Voting Rights Act of 1965), electronic ballots can be programmed to provide ballots in multiple languages for a single machine.  The advantage with respect to ballots in different languages appears to be unique to electronic voting. For example, King County, Washington's demographics require them under U.S. federal election law to provide ballot access in Chinese. With any type of paper ballot, the county has to decide how many Chinese-language ballots to print, how many to make available at each polling place, etc.  Any strategy that can assure that Chinese-language ballots will be available at all polling places is certain, at the very least, to result in a significant number of wasted ballots.[citation needed] (The situation with lever machines would be even worse than with paper: the only apparent way to reliably meet the need would be to set up a Chinese-language lever machine at each polling place, few of which would be used at all.)\n Critics argue[who?] the need for extra ballots in any language can be mitigated by providing a process to print ballots at voting locations.  They argue further, the cost of software validation, compiler trust validation, installation validation, delivery validation and validation of other steps related to electronic voting is complex and expensive, thus electronic ballots are not guaranteed to be less costly than printed ballots.[citation needed]\n Electronic voting machines can be made fully accessible for persons with disabilities. Punched card and optical scan machines are not fully accessible for the blind or visually impaired, and lever machines can be difficult for voters with limited mobility and strength.[81] Electronic machines can use headphones, sip and puff, foot pedals, joy sticks and other adaptive technology to provide the necessary accessibility.\n Organizations such as the Verified Voting Foundation have criticized the accessibility of electronic voting machines[82] and advocate alternatives. Some disabled voters (including the visually impaired) could use a tactile ballot, a ballot system using physical markers to indicate where a mark should be made, to vote a secret paper ballot. These ballots can be designed identically to those used by other voters.[83] However, other disabled voters (including voters with dexterity disabilities) could be unable to use these ballots.\n The concept of election verifiability through cryptographic solutions has emerged in the academic literature to introduce transparency and trust in electronic voting systems.[84][85] It allows voters and election observers to verify that votes have been recorded, tallied and declared correctly, in a manner independent from the hardware and software running the election. Three aspects of verifiability are considered:[86] individual, universal, and eligibility. Individual verifiability allows a voter to check that her own vote is included in the election outcome, universal verifiability allows voters or election observers to check that the election outcome corresponds to the votes cast, and eligibility verifiability allows voters and observers to check that each vote in the election outcome was cast by a uniquely registered voter.\n Electronic voting machines are able to provide immediate feedback to the voter detecting such possible problems as undervoting and overvoting which may result in a spoiled ballot. This immediate feedback can be helpful in successfully determining voter intent.\n It has been alleged by groups such as the UK-based Open Rights Group[87][88] that a lack of testing, inadequate audit procedures, and insufficient attention given to system or process design with electronic voting leaves \"elections open to error and fraud\".\n In 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany found that when using voting machines the \"verification of the result must be possible by the citizen reliably and without any specialist knowledge of the subject.\" The DRE Nedap-computers used till then did not fulfill that requirement. The decision did not ban electronic voting as such, but requires all essential steps in elections to be subject to public examinability.[89][90]\n In 2013, The California Association of Voting Officials was formed to maintain efforts toward publicly owned General Public License open source voting systems\n In 2013, researchers from Europe proposed that the electronic voting systems should be coercion evident.[91] There should be a public evidence of the amount of coercion that took place in a particular elections. An internet voting system called \"Caveat Coercitor\"[92] shows how coercion evidence in voting systems can be achieved.[91]\n A fundamental challenge with any voting machine is to produce evidence that the votes were recorded as cast and tabulated as recorded. Election results produced by voting systems that rely on voter-marked paper ballots can be verified with manual hand counts (either valid sampling or full recounts). Paperless ballot voting systems must support auditability in different ways. An independently auditable system, sometimes called an Independent Verification, can be used in recounts or audits. These systems can include the ability for voters to verify how their votes were cast or enable officials to verify that votes were tabulated correctly.\n A discussion draft argued by researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) states, \"Simply put, the DRE architecture\u2019s inability to provide for independent audits of its electronic records makes it a poor choice for an environment in which detecting errors and fraud is important.\"[93] The report does not represent the official position of NIST, and misinterpretations of the report has led NIST to explain that \"Some statements in the report have been misinterpreted. The draft report includes statements from election officials, voting system vendors, computer scientists and other experts in the field about what is potentially possible in terms of attacks on DREs. However, these statements are not report conclusions.\"[94]\n Various technologies can be used to assure DRE voters that their votes were cast correctly, and allow officials to detect possible fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the tabulated results. Some systems include technologies such as cryptography (visual or mathematical), paper (kept by the voter or verified and left with election officials), audio verification, and dual recording or witness systems (other than with paper).\n Dr. Rebecca Mercuri, the creator of the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) concept (as described in her Ph.D. dissertation in October 2000 on the basic voter verifiable ballot system), proposes to answer the auditability question by having the voting machine print a paper ballot or other paper facsimile that can be visually verified by the voter before being entered into a secure location. Subsequently, this is sometimes referred to as the \"Mercuri method.\" To be truly voter-verified, the record itself must be verified by the voter and able to be done without assistance, such as visually or audibly.  If the voter must use a bar-code scanner or other electronic device to verify, then the record is not truly voter-verifiable, since it is actually the electronic device that is verifying the record for the voter. VVPAT is the form of Independent Verification most commonly found in elections in the United States and other countries such as Venezuela.[95]\n End-to-end auditable voting systems can provide the voter with a receipt that can be taken home. This receipt does not allow voters to prove to others how they voted, but it does allow them to verify that the system detected their vote correctly. End-to-end (E2E) systems include Punchscan, ThreeBallot and Pr\u00eat \u00e0 Voter. Scantegrity is an add-on that extends current optical scan voting systems with an E2E layer. The city of Takoma Park, Maryland used Scantegrity II for its November 2009 election.[96][97]\n Systems that allow the voter to prove how they voted are never used in U.S. public elections, and are outlawed by most state constitutions. The primary concerns with this solution are voter intimidation and vote selling.\n An audit system can be used in measured random recounts to detect possible malfunction or fraud. With the VVPAT method, the paper ballot is often treated as the official ballot of record. In this scenario, the ballot is primary and the electronic records are used only for an initial count. In any subsequent recounts or challenges, the paper, not the electronic ballot, would be used for tabulation. Whenever a paper record serves as the legal ballot, that system will be subject to the same benefits and concerns as any paper ballot system.\n To successfully audit any voting machine, a strict chain of custody is required.\n The solution was first demonstrated (New York City, March 2001) and used (Sacramento, California 2002) by AVANTE International Technology, Inc.. In 2004 Nevada was the first state to successfully implement a DRE voting system that printed an electronic record. The $9.3 million voting system provided by Sequoia Voting Systems included more than 2,600 AVC EDGE touchscreen DREs equipped with the VeriVote VVPAT component.\n[98] The new systems, implemented under the direction of then Secretary of State Dean Heller replaced largely punched card voting systems and were chosen after feedback was solicited from the community through town hall meetings and input solicited from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.[99]\n Inadequately secured hardware can be subject to physical tampering. Some critics, such as the group \"Wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet\" (\"We do not trust voting machines\"), charge that, for instance, foreign hardware could be inserted into the machine, or between the user and the central mechanism of the machine itself, using a man in the middle attack technique, and thus even sealing DRE machines may not be sufficient protection.[100] This claim is countered by the position that review and testing procedures can detect fraudulent code or hardware, if such things are present, and that a thorough, verifiable chain of custody would prevent the insertion of such hardware or software.[citation needed] Security seals are commonly employed in an attempt to detect tampering, but testing by Argonne National Laboratory and others demonstrates that existing seals can usually be quickly defeated by a trained person using low-tech methods.[101]\n Security experts, such as Bruce Schneier, have demanded that voting machine source code should be publicly available for inspection.[102] Others have also suggested publishing voting machine software under a free software license as is done in Australia.[103]\n One method to detect errors with voting machines is parallel testing, which are conducted on the Election Day with randomly picked machines. The ACM published a study showing that, to change the outcome of the 2000 U.S. Presidential election, only 2 votes in each precinct would have needed to be changed.[104]\n Cost of having electronic machines receive the voter's choices, print a ballot and scan the ballots to tally results is higher than the cost of printing blank ballots, having voters mark them directly (with machine-marking only when voters want it) and scanning ballots to tally results, according to studies in Georgia,[105][106] New York[107] and Pennsylvania.[108]\n Electronic voting by country varies and may include voting machines in polling places, centralized tallying of paper ballots, and internet voting. Many countries use centralized tallying. Some also use electronic voting machines in polling places. Very few use internet voting. Several countries have tried electronic approaches and stopped because of difficulties or concerns about security and reliability.\n Electronic voting requires capital spending every few years to update equipment, as well as annual spending for maintenance, security, and supplies. If it works well, its speed can be an advantage where many contests are on each ballot. Hand-counting is more feasible in parliamentary systems where each level of government is elected at different times, and only one contest is on each ballot, for the national or regional member of parliament, or for a local council member.\n In the 2006 film Man of the Year starring Robin Williams, the character played by Williams\u2014a comedic host of political talk show\u2014wins the election for President of the United States when a software error in the electronic voting machines produced by the fictional manufacturer Delacroy causes votes to be tallied inaccurately.\n In Runoff, a 2007 novel by Mark Coggins, a surprising showing by the Green Party candidate in a San Francisco Mayoral election forces a runoff between him and the highly favored establishment candidate\u2014a plot line that closely parallels the actual results of the 2003 election. When the private-eye protagonist of the book investigates at the behest of a powerful Chinatown businesswoman, he determines that the outcome was rigged by someone who defeated the security on the city's newly installed e-voting system.[119]\n \"Hacking Democracy\" is a 2006 documentary film shown on HBO. Filmed over three years, it documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems that occurred during America's 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems and culminates in the hacking of a Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida.\n The central conflict in the MMO video game Infantry resulted from the global institution of direct democracy through the use of personal voting devices sometime in the 22nd century AD. The practice gave rise to a 'voting class' of citizens composed mostly of homemakers and retirees who tended to be at home all day. Because they had the most free time to participate in voting, their opinions ultimately came to dominate politics.[120]\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election": "\n Donald Trump\nRepublican\n Joe Biden\nDemocratic\n The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.[a] The Democratic ticket of former vice president Joe Biden and the junior U.S. senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent Republican president Donald Trump and incumbent vice president Mike Pence.[9] The election took place against the backdrop of the global COVID-19 pandemic and related recession. It was the first election since 1992 in which the incumbent president failed to win a second term. The election saw the highest voter turnout by percentage since 1900, with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008. Biden received more than 81 million votes,[10] the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.[11]\n In a competitive primary that featured the most candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics, Biden secured the Democratic presidential nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden's running mate, Harris, became the first African-American, first Asian-American, and third female[d] vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Trump secured re-nomination, getting a total of 2,549 delegates, one of the most in presidential primary history, to runner-up Bill Weld's one delegate in the Republican primaries.[12] Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian presidential nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate, and Howie Hawkins secured the Green presidential nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate.\n The central issues of the election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; civil unrest in reaction to the police murder of George Floyd and others; the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett; and the future of the Affordable Care Act.[13][14][15] Due to the ongoing pandemic, a record number of ballots were cast early and by mail.[16] Many more registered Democrats voted by mail than registered Republicans.[17][18] As a result of a large number of mail-in ballots, some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting; this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of Biden and Harris as the president-elect and vice president-elect until the morning of November 7, three and a half days after the election. Major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high statistical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state.[19]\n Biden ultimately received the majority in the Electoral College with 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232. Key to Biden's victory were his wins in the Democratic-leaning Great Lakes states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which Trump carried in 2016 and whose combined 46 electoral votes were enough to swing the election to either candidate. Biden also became the first Democrat to win a presidential election in Georgia since 1992, in Arizona since 1996, and in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district since 2008.[20][21]\n Before, during, and after Election Day, Trump and numerous other Republicans engaged in an aggressive and unprecedented[22][23][24][25][26] attempt to subvert the election and overturn the results, falsely alleging widespread voter fraud and trying to influence the vote-counting process in swing states,[27][28][29][30] in what was described by many as an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat. Attorney General William Barr and officials in each of the 50 states found no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election.[31][32] Federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in American history.[33][34][35] The Trump campaign and its allies, including Republican members of Congress,[36] continued to engage in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by filing 63 lawsuits in several states (all of which were withdrawn or dismissed),[37][38][39] spreading conspiracy theories alleging fraud,[40] pressuring Republican state election officials (including, notably, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in a phone call that later became widely publicized) and legislators to change results,[41] pressuring the Department of Justice to declare the election \"corrupt\" and intervene,[42][43] objecting to the Electoral College certification in Congress,[44][45] and refusing to cooperate with the presidential transition of Joe Biden.[46]  With Trump vowing that he would never concede the election and after exhorting his followers to \"fight like hell,\" a mob of Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, during the joint session of Congress held to certify the Electoral College count.[47][48][49] On January 7, Trump acknowledged the incoming administration without mentioning Biden's name.[50][51][52] Biden and Harris were inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties in the United States. Each party develops a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket, which is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention (except for the Libertarian Party, which nominates its vice-presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.[53] If no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, the United States House of Representatives will select the president from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the United States Senate will select the vice president from among the candidates who received the two highest totals. The presidential election occurred simultaneously alongside elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and various state and local-level elections.[54]\n The Maine Legislature passed a bill in August 2019 adopting ranked-choice voting (RCV) both for presidential primaries and for the general election.[55][56] Governor Janet Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed its taking effect until after the 2020 Democratic primary in March and made Maine the first state to use RCV for a presidential general election. The Maine Republican Party filed signatures for a veto referendum to preclude the use of RCV for the 2020 election, but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. A challenge in Maine Superior Court was successful for the Maine Republican Party, but the Maine Supreme Judicial Court[57][58] stayed the ruling pending appeal on September 8, 2020.[59] Nevertheless, ballots began being printed later that day without the veto referendum and including RCV for the presidential election,[60][61] and the Court ruled in favor of the Secretary of State on September 22, allowing RCV to be used.[62] An emergency appeal to the Supreme Court was denied on October 6.[63] The law continues the use of the congressional district method for the allocation of Maine's electors (Nebraska is the only other state that apportions its electoral votes this way).[64] While multiple rounds of vote counting were not needed due to a single candidate receiving a majority of first-choice votes statewide and in each district, use of RCV complicates interpretation of the national popular vote because voters are more likely to vote for third-party or independent candidates.[65]\n On December 14, 2020, pledged electors for each candidate, known collectively as the United States Electoral College, gathered in their states' capitols to cast their official votes. Pursuant to the processes laid out by the Electoral Count Act of 1887, certificates of ascertainment listing the names of the electors and separate certificates recording their votes are distributed to various officials across the branches of government.[66][67][68] The newly elected Congress, with the Vice President in his role as Senate President presiding, met in a joint session to formally open the certificates and count the votes, which began on January 6, 2021, was interrupted by the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and finished the following day.[69]\n The presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states. For the subsequent election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the 2020 United States Census, and the states will conduct a redistricting of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states, the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting, although some states have redistricting commissions. Often, a party that wins a presidential election experiences a coattail effect that also helps other candidates of that party win elections.[70] Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a significant advantage in drawing new congressional and state legislative districts, which would stay in effect until 2032.[71]\n Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 5, 2020, when he secured enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the national convention.[72] He was formally nominated at the convention on August 18.[73]\n Every incumbent president seeking another term, with the partial exception of Lyndon Johnson in 1968,[74] has been renominated by their party since 1884.[75] Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, were able to easily secure the nomination after receiving enough delegates in the 2020 Republican presidential primaries.[76][77]\n Jo Jorgensen, who was the running mate of author Harry Browne in 1996, received the Libertarian nomination at the national convention on May 23, 2020.[78] She achieved ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[79]\n Howie Hawkins became the presumptive nominee of the Green Party on June 21, 2020, and was officially nominated by the party on July 11, 2020.[80][81] Hawkins secured ballot access in 29 states and the District of Columbia, representing 381 electoral votes, and write-in access in 16 more states, representing 130 electoral votes.[82][83][e]\n The 2020 Democratic National Convention was originally scheduled for July 13\u201316 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,[86][87][88] but was delayed to August 17\u201320 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[89] On June 24, 2020, it was announced that the convention would be held in a mixed online in-person format, with most delegates attending remotely but a few still attending the physical convention site.[90] On August 5, the in-person portion of the convention was scaled down even further; major speeches, including Biden's, were switched to a virtual format.[91]\n The 2020 Republican National Convention took place from August 24\u201327 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and various remote locations. Originally, a three-day convention was planned to be held in North Carolina, but due to North Carolina's insistence that the convention follow COVID-19 social distancing rules, the speeches and celebrations were moved to Jacksonville, Florida (official convention business was still contractually obligated to be conducted in Charlotte).[92][93] Due to the worsening situation with regards to COVID-19 in Florida, the plans there were cancelled, and the convention was moved back to Charlotte in a scaled-down capacity.[94]\n The 2020 Libertarian National Convention was originally scheduled to be held in Austin, Texas, over Memorial Day weekend from May 22 to 25,[95][96] but all reservations at the JW Marriott Downtown Austin for the convention were cancelled on April 26 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[97] The Libertarian National Committee eventually decided the party would hold two conventions, one online from May 22\u201324 to select the presidential and vice-presidential nominees and one at a physical convention in Orlando, Florida, from July 8\u201312 for other business.[98]\n The 2020 Green National Convention was originally to be held in Detroit, Michigan, from July 9\u00a0to 12.[88] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the convention was instead held online, without a change in date.[99]\n The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on two counts on December 18, 2019.[100] The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,[101] and ended on February 5, resulting in acquittal by the United States Senate.[102]\n This is the second time a president has been impeached during his first term while running for a second term.[103][i] Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.[105][106] This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.[107] The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.[108][109]\n Several events related to the 2020 presidential election were altered or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and its effects, such as stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines by local governments. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.[110][111] On March 12, Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.[112] The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the CNN studios in Washington, D.C.[113] Several states also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,[114] Kentucky,[115] Louisiana,[116] Ohio,[117] and Maryland.[118] As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates had halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over COVID-19 concerns. Political analysts speculated at the time that the moratorium on traditional campaigning, coupled with the effects of the pandemic on the nation, could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.[119][120][121]\n Some presidential primary elections were severely disrupted by COVID-19-related issues, including long lines at polling places, greatly increased requests for absentee ballots, and technology issues.[122] Due to a shortage of election workers able or willing to work during the pandemic, the number of polling places was often greatly reduced. Most states expanded or encouraged voting by mail as an alternative, but many voters complained that they never received the absentee ballots they had requested.[123]\n The March 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act included money for states to increase mail-in voting. By May, Trump and his campaign strongly opposed mail-in voting, claiming that it would cause widespread voter fraud, a belief that has been discredited by a number of media organizations.[124][125] Government response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled with the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding economic stimulus, became a major campaign issue for both parties.[126][127]\n On April 6, the Supreme Court and Republicans in the State Legislature of Wisconsin rebuffed Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers's request to move the state's spring elections to June. As a result, the elections, which included a presidential primary, went ahead on April\u00a07 as planned.[128] At least seven new cases of COVID-19 were traced to this election. Voting-rights advocates expressed fear of similar chaos on a nationwide scale in November, recommending states move to expand vote-by-mail options.[129]\n On June 20, 2020, Trump's campaign held an in-person rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the event could go ahead despite continuing concerns over COVID-19.[130] Attendance at the rally was far lower than expected, being described as a \"flop\", and it led to a significant worsening of relations between Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale.[131] 7.7 million people watched the event on Fox News, a Saturday audience record for that channel.[132] Three weeks after the rally, the Oklahoma State Department of Health recorded record numbers of cases of COVID-19,[133] and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of the virus, although it was not confirmed that he caught the disease due to his attendance at the rally.[134]\n On October 2, 2020, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 following a positive test from his senior advisor, Hope Hicks, as part of the larger COVID-19 outbreak among White House personnel. Both the president and first lady immediately entered quarantine, which prevented Trump from further campaigning, notably at campaign rallies.[135][136][137] Later that day, the President was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with a low grade fever, where he was reported to have received an experimental antibody treatment.[138][139] Trump's diagnosis came only two days after he had shared the stage with Biden at the first presidential debate and raised the possibility that Biden had caught the virus from Trump; Biden tested negative.[140][141] Trump was discharged from the hospital on October 5.[142]\n Trump being diagnosed with COVID-19 was widely seen as having a negative effect on his campaign and shifted the attention of the public back onto COVID-19, an issue which is generally seen as a liability for Trump, due to his response to the COVID-19 pandemic suffering from low approval ratings.[143][144] Being in quarantine also meant Trump was unable to attend rallies, which were a major part of his campaign. As a result of Trump contracting COVID-19, Biden continued campaigning but temporarily ceased running attack ads against him.[145][146] On October 12, one week after his discharge from the hospital, Trump resumed in-person rallies.[142] Trump continued to travel to battleground states and hold mass rallies, sometimes two or three in a day. His rallies have been criticized for their lack of social distancing or mask wearing, and some polls suggest that voters see him less favorably for potentially endangering attendees.[147][148]\n U.S. officials accused Russia, China, and Iran of trying to influence the 2020 United States elections.[149][150] On October 4, 2019, Microsoft announced that \"Phosphorus\", a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government, had attempted to compromise e-mail accounts belonging to journalists, U.S. government officials and the campaign of a U.S. presidential candidate.[151][152] The American Government owned Voice of America reported in April 2020 that \"Internet security researchers say there have already been signs that China-allied hackers have engaged in so-called 'spear-phishing' attacks on American political targets ahead of the 2020 vote.\" Chinese spokesman Geng Shuang denied the allegations and said he would \"hope the people of the U.S. not drag China into its electoral politics\".[153]\n On February 13, 2020, American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected.[154][155] The briefing was delivered by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community's top election security official and an aide to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. On February 21, The Washington Post reported that, according to unnamed U.S. officials, Russia was interfering in the Democratic primary in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders issued a statement after the news report, saying in part, \"I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president, I will make sure that you do.\"[156] Sanders acknowledged that his campaign was briefed about Russia's alleged efforts about a month prior.[157] In a February 2020 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. intelligence officials warned Congress that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to support Trump's reelection campaign; Trump was angered that Congress had been informed of the threat, and the day after the briefing castigated the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, for allowing the briefing to go forward.[158][159] China and some government-linked Chinese individuals have been accused of interfering in the election to support the candidacy of both Biden and Trump,[160] though whether it is actually doing so is disputed among the intelligence community.[159][161]\n On October 21, threatening emails were sent to Democrats in at least four states. The emails warned, \"You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.\"[162] Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that evening that the emails, using a spoofed return address, had been sent by Iran. He added that both Iran and Russia are known to have obtained American voter registration data, possibly from publicly available information, and \"This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy.\" A spokesman for Iran denied the allegation.[163] In his announcement, Ratcliffe said Iran's intent had been \"to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump\", raising questions as to how ordering Democrats to vote for Trump would be damaging to Trump. It was later reported that the reference to Trump had not been in Ratcliffe's prepared remarks as signed off by the other officials on the stage; he had added it on his own.[164] On November 18, 2021, the Justice Department charged two Iranian hackers with attempting to intimidate American voters ahead of the 2020 U.S. election by sending threatening emails and spreading false information.[165]\n Throughout the election period, several Colombian lawmakers and the Colombian ambassador to the United States issued statements supporting the Donald Trump campaign, which has been viewed as potentially harmful to Colombia\u2013United States relations.[166][167] On October 26, the U.S. Ambassador to Colombia, Philip Goldberg, requested that Colombian politicians abstain from getting involved in the elections.[168]\n The Department of Justice is investigating whether the Trump Victory Committee accepted a $100,000 donation from Malaysian businessman and international fugitive Jho Low, who is accused of being the mastermind behind the multibillion-dollar 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal involving a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB.[169][170]\n Government officials and American corporate security officers braced for a repeat of 2016's election infrastructure hacking and similar twenty-first century attacks, and in fact conducted what were characterized as preemptive counter-strikes on botnet infrastructure which might be used in large-scale coordination of hacking,[171] and some incidents earlier in the year appeared to foreshadow such possibilities. Nonetheless, after his dismissal, in a December 2020 interview, Chris Krebs, the Trump administration's director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), described monitoring Election Day from CISA's joint command center along with representatives from the military's United States Cyber Command, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), representatives of vendors of voting machine equipment, and representatives of state and local governments, as well as his agency's analysis preceding and after that day, saying, \"It was quiet. There was no indication or evidence that there was any sort of hacking or compromise of election systems on, before, or after November third.\"[172] Responding to spurious claims of foreign outsourcing of vote counting as a rationale behind litigation attempting to stop official vote-counting in some areas, Krebs also affirmed that, \"All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America.\"[172]\n Acts of foreign interference included Russian state-directed application of computational propaganda approaches, more conventional state-sponsored Internet propaganda, smaller-scale disinformation efforts, \"information laundering\" and \"trading up the chain\" propaganda tactics employing some government officials, Trump affiliates, and US media outlets.[173]\n During the campaign, Trump indicated in Twitter posts, interviews, and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated; Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him.[174][175][176] In July 2020, Trump declined to answer whether he would accept the results, just as he did in the 2016 presidential election, telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that \"I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no.\"[177][178][179][180] Trump repeatedly claimed that \"the only way\" he could lose would be if the election was \"rigged\" and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election.[181][182] Trump also attacked mail-in voting throughout the campaign, falsely claiming that the practice contains high rates of fraud;[183][184][185] at one point, Trump said, \"We'll see what happens\u00a0... Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful\u00a0\u2013 there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.\"[186] Trump's statements have been described as a threat \"to upend the constitutional order\".[187] In September 2020, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, who was appointed by Trump, testified under oath that the FBI has \"not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise\".[188]\n A number of congressional Republicans insisted they were committed to an orderly and peaceful transition of power, but declined to criticize Trump for his comments.[189] On September 24, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the Senate's commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.[190] Trump has also stated he expected the Supreme Court to decide the election and that he wanted a conservative majority in case of an election dispute, reiterating his commitment to quickly install a ninth justice following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[191]\n In April 2020, Biden suggested that Trump might try to delay the election, saying he \"is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held\".[192][193] On July 30, Trump tweeted that \"With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history\" and asked if it should be delayed until people can safely cast ballots in person. Experts[who?] have indicated that, for the election to be legally delayed, such a decision must be made by Congress.[194][195] And the Constitution sets the end of the presidential and vice-presidential terms at January 20, a hard deadline which cannot be altered by Congress except by constitutional amendment.[196][197]\n Postal voting in the United States has become increasingly common, with 25% of voters mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018. By June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places.[199] An August 2020 state-by-state analysis concluded that 76% of Americans were eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020\u00a0\u2013 more than double the number in 2016.[200] The Postal Service sent a letter to multiple states in July 2020, warning that the service would not be able to meet the state's deadlines for requesting and casting last-minute absentee ballots.[201] In addition to the anticipated high volume of mailed ballots, the prediction was due in part to numerous measures taken by Louis DeJoy, the newly installed United States Postmaster General, including banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail,[202] which caused delays in delivering mail,[203] and dismantling and removing hundreds of high-speed mail sorting machines from postal centers.[204] On August 18, after the House of Representatives had been recalled from its August break to vote on a bill reversing the changes, DeJoy announced that he would roll back all the changes until after the November election. He said he would reinstate overtime hours, roll back service reductions, and halt the removal of mail-sorting machines and collection boxes.[205]\n The House of Representatives voted an emergency grant of $25\u00a0billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots.[206] Although Trump has repeatedly denounced mail voting, he has mailed in ballots due to being in a different state than the one where he votes at the time of the election.[207] In August 2020, Trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mail-in voting, but said he would block any additional funding for the post office to prevent any increase in balloting by mail.[208]\n The Trump campaign filed lawsuits seeking to block the use of official ballot dropboxes in Pennsylvania in locations other than an election office, and also sought to \"block election officials from counting mail-in ballots if a voter forgets to put their mail-in ballot in a secrecy sleeve within the ballot return-envelope\".[209] The Trump campaign and the Republican Party both failed to produce any evidence of vote-by-mail fraud after being ordered by a federal judge to do so.[209]\n On Election Day, a judge ordered mail inspectors to search \"mail facilities in\u00a0.... key battleground states\" for ballots.[210] The agency refused to comply with the order and nearly 7% of ballots in USPS facilities on Election Day were not processed in time.[211]\n The Federal Election Commission, which was created in 1974 to enforce campaign finance laws in federal elections, has not functioned since July 2020 due to vacancies in membership. In the absence of a quorum, the commission cannot vote on complaints or give guidance through advisory opinions.[212] As of May 19, 2020, there were 350 outstanding matters on the agency's enforcement docket and 227 items waiting for action.[213] As of September 1, 2020, Trump had not nominated anyone to fill the FEC vacancies.[214]\n On September 18, 2020, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately said the precedent he had set regarding the Merrick Garland nomination was inoperative and that a replacement would be voted on as soon as possible, setting the stage for a confirmation battle and an unexpected intrusion into the campaign.[215] The death of Justice Ginsburg resulted in large increases in momentum for both the Democrats and Republicans.[216][217] The president,[218] vice president,[219] and several Republican members of Congress said a full Supreme Court bench was needed to decide the upcoming election.[220][221]\n On September 26, the day after Justice Ginsburg's body lay in state at the Capitol, Trump held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House to announce and introduce his candidate, Amy Coney Barrett.[222] After four days of confirmation hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted the nomination out of committee on October 22,[223] and on October 26, Barrett was confirmed on a party-line vote of 52\u201348, with no Democrats voting for her confirmation.[224] This was the closest Supreme Court confirmation ever to a presidential election, and the first Supreme Court nomination since 1869 with no supporting votes from the minority party.[224] It was also one of the fastest timelines from nomination to confirmations in U.S. history.[225][226]\n By September 2020, several hundred legal cases relating to the election had been filed.[227] About 250 of these had to do with the mechanics of voting in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.[227] The Supreme Court ruled on a number of these cases,[228] primarily issuing emergency stays instead of going through the normal process due to the urgency.[229] In October 2020, there was speculation that the election might be decided through a Supreme Court case, as happened following the 2000 election.[230][231]\n On October 11, 2019, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced that three general election debates would be held in the fall of 2020.[232]\n The first, moderated by Chris Wallace, took place on September 29, and was co-hosted by Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio.[233] The debate was originally to be hosted at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, but the university decided against holding the debate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[233][234] Biden was generally held to have won the first debate,[235][236][237] with a significant minority of commentators deeming it a draw.[238][239]\n One exchange that was particularly noted was when Trump did not directly denounce the white supremacist and neo-fascist group Proud Boys, instead responding that they should \"stand back and stand by\".[240][241][242] On the next day, Trump told reporters the group should \"stand down\" while also claiming that he was not aware of what the group was.[243][244] The debate was described as \"chaotic and nearly incoherent\" because of Trump's repeated interruptions, causing the CPD to consider adjustments to the format of the remaining debates.[245]\n The vice presidential debate was held on October 7, 2020, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.[246] The debate was widely held to be subdued, with no clear victor.[247][248] One incident that was particularly commented on was when a fly landed on vice-president Pence's head, and remained there unbeknownst to him for two minutes.[249][250]\n The second debate was initially set to be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but the university withdrew in June 2020, over concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.[251] The planned debate was rescheduled for October 15 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami; due to Trump contracting COVID-19, the CPD announced on October\u00a08 that the debate would be held virtually, in which the candidates would appear from separate locations. Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate, and the commission subsequently announced that the debate had been cancelled.[252][253]\n The third scheduled debate took place on October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and was moderated by Kristen Welker.[254][255] The changes to the debate rules, which included the candidates' microphones being muted while the other was speaking,[256] resulted in it being generally considered more civil than the first debate.[257] Welker's performance as moderator was praised, with her being regarded as having done a good job preventing the candidates from interrupting each other.[258] Biden was generally held to have won the debate, though it was considered unlikely to alter the race to any considerable degree.[259][260][261]\n The Free & Equal Elections Foundation held two debates with various third party and independent candidates, one on October 8, 2020, in Denver, Colorado,[266] and another on October 24, 2020, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.[267]\n The following graph depicts the standing of each candidate in the poll aggregators from September 2019 to November 2020. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, had an average polling lead of 7.9 percentage points over incumbent President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden would win the national popular vote by 4.4 percentage points. \n Calculated averages are not comparable to those for the Biden vs. Trump polls. As polling with third parties has been very limited, the polls included in the average are often different.\n The following graph depicts the difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in each swing state in the poll aggregators from March 2020 to the election, with the election results for comparison.\n OpenSecrets estimated the total cost of the 2020 election nearly $14 billion, making it the most expensive election in history and twice as expensive as the previous presidential election cycle.[268]\n The COVID-19 pandemic was a major issue of the campaign, with Trump's responses being heavily criticized. The president spread mixed messages on the value of wearing face masks as protection, including criticizing Biden and reporters for wearing them, but has also encouraged their use at times.[269] During the campaign, Trump held many events across the country, including in COVID-19 hotspots, where attendees did not wear masks and were not socially distancing; at the same time, he mocked those who wore face masks.[270][271][272]\n Biden advocated for the expansion of federal funding, including funding under the Defense Production Act for testing, personal protective equipment, and research.[273] Trump also invoked the Defense Production Act to control the distribution of masks and ventilators,[274] but his response plan relied significantly on a vaccine being released by the end of 2020.[273] At the second presidential debate, Trump claimed Biden had called him xenophobic for restricting entry from foreign nationals who had visited China, but Biden responded that he had not been referring to this decision.[275]\n Trump claimed credit for the consistent economic expansion of his presidency's first three years, with the stock market at its longest growth period in history and unemployment at a fifty-year low. Additionally, he has touted the 2020 third-quarter rebound, in which GDP grew at an annualized rate of 33.1%, as evidence of the success of his economic policies.[276] Biden responded to Trump's claims by repeating that the strong economy under Trump's presidency was inherited from the Obama administration, and that Trump has aggravated the economic impact of the pandemic, including the need for 42 million Americans to file for unemployment.[277]\n The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered income taxes for many Americans and lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, were a major component of Trump's economic policy. Biden and the Democrats generally describe these cuts as unfairly benefiting the upper class. Biden plans to raise taxes on corporations and those making over $400,000 per year, while keeping the reduced taxes on lower-income brackets and raise capital gains taxes to a maximum bracket of 39.6%. In response, Trump said Biden's plans would destroy retirement accounts and the stock market.[278]\n Trump and Biden's views on environmental policy differ significantly. Trump stated that climate change is a hoax, although he also called it a serious subject.[279] Trump condemned the Paris Agreement on greenhouse gas reduction and began the withdrawal process. Biden planned to rejoin it and announced a $2\u00a0trillion plan to combat climate change. Biden had not fully accepted the Green New Deal. Biden did not plan to ban fracking but rather to outlaw new fracking on federal land. In a debate, Trump claimed Biden wanted to ban it altogether. Trump's other environmental policies included the removal of methane emission standards, and an expansion of mining.[280]\n Health care was a divisive issue in both the Democratic primary campaign and the general campaign. While Biden, as well as other candidates, promised protection of the Affordable Care Act, progressives within the Democratic Party advocated to replace the private insurance industry with Medicare for All. Biden's plan involves adding a public option to the American healthcare system,[281] and the restoration of the individual mandate to buy health care, which was removed from the Affordable Care Act by the 2017 tax cut bill,[282] as well as restoring funding for Planned Parenthood. Trump announced plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, calling it \"too expensive\", but he did not say what would replace it.[283] At the time of the election, the Trump administration and Republican officials from 18 states had a lawsuit before the Supreme Court, asking the court to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[284]\n As a result of the murder of George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality against African Americans, combined with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of protests and a wider period of racial unrest erupted in mid-2020. This was followed by the Black Lives Matter movement, which protested police brutality against black people, and became a central point of the 2020 presidential campaign.[285] Protests were as a rule peaceful; fewer than 4% involved property damage or violence (with most of the latter directed at BLM protesters themselves).[286] According to a September 2020 estimate, arson, vandalism, and looting caused about $1\u20132\u00a0billion in insured damage between May 26 and June 8, making this initial phase of the George Floyd protests the civil disorder event with the highest recorded damage in United States history.[287][288]\n In response, Trump and the Republicans suggested sending in the military to counter the protests, which was criticized, especially by Democrats, as heavy-handed and potentially illegal.[289] Trump referred to Black Lives Matter protesters confronting diners in a restaurant as \"thugs\",[290] and called the movement a \"symbol of hate\".[291] Particularly controversial was a photo-op Trump took in front of St. John's Church in Washington D.C., before which military police had forcefully cleared peaceful protestors from the area.[282] Biden condemned Trump for his actions against protestors; he described George Floyd's words \"I can't breathe\" as a \"wake-up call for our nation\". He also promised he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president, and establish a uniform use of force standard, as well as other police reform measures.[292]\n More than 158 million votes were cast in the election.[307] More than 100 million of them were cast before Election Day by early voting or mail ballot, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.[308] The election saw the highest voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voters since 1900,[309] with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008.[310] The Biden\u2013Harris ticket received more than 81 million votes, the most votes ever in a U.S. presidential election.[10][11] It was also the ninth consecutive presidential election where the victorious major party nominee did not receive a popular vote majority by a double-digit margin over the losing major party nominee(s), continuing the longest sequence of such presidential elections in U.S. history, which began in 1988 and in 2016 eclipsed the previous longest sequence, that from 1876 through 1900.[311][note 1][312] In 2020, 58 percent of U.S. voters lived in landslide counties,[313] a decline from 61 percent in 2016.[314]\n Trump became the first U.S. president since 1992 and the eleventh incumbent in the country's history to lose a bid for a second term. Biden's 51.3% of the popular vote was the highest for a challenger to an incumbent president since 1932.[315][316][317][m] Biden is the sixth vice president to become president without succeeding to the office on the death or resignation of a previous president.[318] Additionally, Trump's loss marked the third time an elected president lost the popular vote twice, the first being John Quincy Adams in the 1820s and Benjamin Harrison in the 1880s and 1890s.[319] This was the first time since 1980, and the first for Republicans since 1892 that a party was voted out after a single four-year term. This was the second election in American history in which the incumbent president lost re-election despite winning a greater share of the popular vote than they did the previous election, after 1828.\n Biden won 25 states, the District of Columbia, and one congressional district in Nebraska, totaling 306 electoral votes. Trump won 25 states and one congressional district in Maine, totaling 232 electoral votes. This result was exactly the reverse of Trump's victory, 306 to 232, in 2016 (excluding faithless electors), making it the first time two consecutive elections featured the same electoral-vote distribution between candidates.[320] Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential election in Georgia since 1992 and in Arizona since 1996,[20] and the first candidate to win nationally without Florida since 1992 and Ohio since 1960, casting doubt on Ohio's continued status as a bellwether state.[321] Biden carried five states won by Trump in 2016: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He also became the first Democrat since 2008 to carry Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, winning one electoral vote from the state. Trump did not win any states won by Clinton in 2016. Biden's three gains in the Rust Belt\u2014Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014were widely characterized as a rebuilding of the blue wall, a term widely used in the press for the states consistently won by Democrats from 1992 to 2012, broken by Trump in 2016 when he flipped those three Rust Belt states.[322][323][324][325] Nevertheless, amidst Trump's national and electoral defeat, his scoring decisive victories in Ohio, Iowa, and Florida for the second time, after their having backed Obama twice, has led many commentators to conclude they have shifted from perennial swing states to reliable red states.[326][327]\n In light of the attempts to contest the election results, an important question is how many votes would have had to change in particular states in order to produce a different Electoral College outcome. If Biden's three narrowest state victories\u2014Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona, all of which he won by less than a percentage point\u2014had gone to Trump, there would have been a tie of 269 electors for each candidate,[328][329] causing a contingent election to be decided by the House of Representatives, where Trump had the advantage. (Even though Democrats controlled the House, contingent elections are determined by state delegations in which each state receives just one vote, and since a slight majority of states in 2020 contained more Republican than Democratic representatives, Republicans would have had more votes in such an election.) This scenario would have required a popular-vote shift of 0.63% or less in each of these three states, a total of about 43,000 votes, 0.03% of votes cast nationally.  A similar situation occurred in 2016, when a shift of 0.77% or less in each of the three most closely contested states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania), or about 77,000 votes, would have resulted in the popular-vote winner Hillary Clinton also winning in the Electoral College.[330]\n Almost all counties previously considered reliable indicators of eventual success in presidential elections voted for Trump instead of Biden, meaning that they did not continue their streaks as bellwether counties. This was attributed to increasing political polarization throughout the country and to the urban\u2013rural divide.[331]\n While Trump still dominated rural America as a whole, there were rural areas that he lost. Biden won 50.5% of the rural counties that each had mostly non-white voters, particularly in the South and the West.[332] Rural counties in the South won by Biden had greater economic distress than those won by Trump; in the Northeast, the opposite was true.[332] In the West, Biden did especially well in rural counties that had high shares of workers employed in leisure and hospitality.[332] Such counties likewise had large constituencies of immigration from other states.[332] Every state won by Biden was won by more votes than those by which Hillary Clinton won the state. The combined vote margin of these states was equal to Biden's gain over Hillary Clinton.[333] Biden became the oldest president ever elected besting Ronald Reagan's record in 1984 and the oldest non-incumbent ever, besting Trump in 2016.\n Major news organizations project a state for a candidate when there is high mathematical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning the state. Election projections are made by decision teams of political scientists and data scientists.[19]\n On the morning of November 7 at approximately 11:30\u00a0a.m. EST, roughly three and a half days after polls had closed, ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, the Associated Press, CNN, and Fox News all called the election for Biden, based on projections of votes in Pennsylvania showing him leading outside of the recount threshold (0.5% in that state).[334][335][336][337][338][339] That evening, Biden and Harris gave victory speeches in Wilmington, Delaware.[340]\n On the invitation of the U.S. State Department, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which has been monitoring U.S. elections since 2002 (as it does for major elections in all other OSCE member countries), sent 102 observers from 39 countries.[341][342][343] The task force consisted of long-term observers from the ODIHR office (led by former Polish diplomat Urszula Gacek) deployed to 28 states from September on and covering 15 states on election day, and a group of European lawmakers acting as short-term observers (led by German parliamentarian Michael Georg Link), reporting from Maryland, Virginia, California, Nevada, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, and D.C.[341][343] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was scaled down to a \"limited election observation mission\" from the originally planned 100 long-term observers and 400 short-term observers.[341]\n An interim report published by the OSCE shortly before the election noted that many ODIHR interlocutors \"expressed grave concerns about the risk of legitimacy of the elections being questioned due to the incumbent President's repeated allegations of a fraudulent election process, and postal vote in particular.\"[341][344] On the day after the election, the task force published preliminary findings,[342] with part of the summary stating:\n The 3 November general elections were competitive and well managed despite legal uncertainties and logistical challenges. In a highly polarized political environment, harsh campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters. Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens. The media, although sharply polarized, provided comprehensive coverage of the campaign and made efforts to provide accurate information on the organization of elections.[345] Link said that \"on the election day itself, we couldn't see any violations\" at the polling places visited by the observers.[342] The task force also found \"nothing untoward\" while observing the handling of mail-in ballots at post offices, with Gacek being quoted as saying: \"We feel that allegations of systemic wrongdoing in these elections have no solid ground. The system has held up well.\"[343] The OSCE's election monitoring branch published a more comprehensive report in early 2021.[343][346]\n Candidates are listed individually below if they received more than 0.1% of the popular vote. Popular vote totals are from the Federal Election Commission report.[1]\n Two states, Maine and Nebraska, allow their electoral votes to be split between candidates by congressional districts. The winner of each congressional district gets one electoral vote for the district. The winner of the statewide vote gets two additional electoral votes.[352][353]\n States where the margin of victory was under 1% (37 electoral votes; all won by Biden):\n States where the margin of victory was between 1% and 5% (86 electoral votes; 42 won by Biden, 44 by Trump):\n States/districts where the margin of victory was between 5% and 10% (80 electoral votes; 17 won by Biden, 63 by Trump):\n Blue denotes states or congressional districts won by Democrat Joe Biden; red denotes those won by Republican Donald Trump.\n Counties with highest percentage of Democratic vote:[354]\n Counties with highest percentage of Republican vote:\n Results by state, shaded according to winning candidate's percentage of the vote\n Results by county\n Results by county, shaded according to winning candidate's percentage of the vote\n A discontinuous cartogram of the 2020 United States presidential election\n A continuous county-level cartogram of the 2020 United States presidential election\n County swing from 2016 to 2020\n Election results by congressional district\n Shaded election results by county (red-purple-blue scale)\n States shaded by margin of victory\n Counties shaded by margin of victory\n Voter demographic data for 2020 were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, and the Associated Press. The voter survey is based on exit polls completed by 15,590 voters in person as well as by phone.[356]\n The Brookings Institution released a report entitled \"Exit polls show both familiar and new voting blocs sealed Biden's win\" on November 12, 2020. In it, author William H. Frey attributes Obama's 2008 win to young people, people of color, and the college-educated. Frey contends Trump won in 2016 thanks to older White without college degrees.[358] Frey says the same coalitions largely held in 2008 and 2016, although in key battleground states Biden increased his vote among some of the 2016 Trump groups, particularly among White and older Americans.[358] Trump won the white vote in 2016 by 20% but in 2020 by only 16%. The Democratic Party won black voters by 75%, the lowest margin since 1980. Democrats won the Latino vote by 32%, which is the smallest margin since 2004, and they won the Asian American vote by 27%, the lowest figure since 2008.[358] Biden reduced the Republican margin of white men without college educations from 48% to 42%, and the Democrats made a slight improvement of 2% among white, college-educated women. People age 18 to 29 registered a rise in Democratic support between 2016 and 2020, with the Democratic margin of victory among that demographic increasing from 19% to 24%.[358]\n Post-election analysis using verified voter data found the Associated Press's Votecast was more accurate than the exit polls.[359][360]\n Biden won 65% of the Latino vote according to Edison Research, and 63% according to the Associated Press. Voto Latino reported that the Latino vote was crucial to the Biden victory in Arizona. 40% of Latino voters who voted in 2020 did not vote in 2016, and 73% of those Latino voters voted for Biden (438,000 voters).[361] Florida and Texas, which have large Latino populations, were carried by Trump. In Florida, Trump won a majority of Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade County, Florida.[362] The Latino vote was still crucial to enable Biden to carry states such as Nevada.[363] Latino voters were targeted by a major Spanish-language disinformation campaign in the final weeks of the election, with various falsehoods and conspiracy theories being pushed out by WhatsApp and viral social media posts.[364][365][366]\n Demographic patterns emerged having to do with country of origin and candidate preference. Pre- and post-election surveys showed Biden winning Latinos of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican,[367] and Spanish heritage,[368] while Trump carried Latinos of Cuban heritage. Data from Florida showed Biden holding a narrow edge among South Americans.[369]\n Biden won 87% of the Black vote, while Trump won 12%.[370] Biden's advantage among Black voters was crucial in the large cities of Pennsylvania and Michigan; the increase in the Democratic vote in Milwaukee County of about 28,000 votes was more than the 20,000-vote lead Biden had in the state of Wisconsin. Almost half Biden's gains in Georgia came from the four largest counties\u00a0\u2013 Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Cobb\u00a0\u2013 all in the Atlanta metro area with large Black populations.[371] Trump improved his overall share of the Black vote from 2016 by 4% and doubled the Black vote that Mitt Romney received in 2012.[372][373][370]\n Polls showed that 68% of Asian American and Pacific Island (AAPI) voters supported Biden/Harris, while 28% supported Trump/Pence. Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at the University of California Riverside and founder of AAPI Data, said Asian Americans supported Biden over Trump by about a 2:1 margin. Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, Indian Americans, and Chinese Americans favored Biden by higher margins overall compared to Vietnamese Americans and Filipino Americans.[374] Many voters were turned off by Trump's language some of which was widely considered racist such as (\"China virus\" and \"kung flu\") but, according to Vox reporter Terry Nguyen, many Vietnamese voters (and especially elderly, South Vietnamese migrants who populated coastal centers in the 1970s) appreciated his strong anti-China stance.[375]\n Data from FiveThirtyEight indicated 65% of Indian American voters backed Joe Biden, and 28% supported Donald Trump.[374] Some Indian Americans self-identified with Kamala Harris, but others approved of Donald Trump's support of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[376] In a speech given to 50,000 Indian-Americans during his 2019 visit to the US, Modi praised Trump with remarks that were interpreted as an indirect endorsement of his candidacy.[377] Indian right-wing organizations like the Hindu Sena had performed special havans and pujas for Trump's electoral victory.[378]\n During the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, a group of Trump supporters held an Indian flag quite prominently. It was held by a US citizen of Indian origin hailing from Kochi in Southern India.[379] Varun Gandhi, a senior parliamentarian from India's ruling BJP, expressed surprise and disapproval of the prominent display of the Indian flag by some of the protestors in one of his tweets; opposition Indian National Congress leader Shashi Tharoor equated the mentality of some Indians with that of Trump supporters.[380]\n Pre-election voter surveys by Indian Country Today found 68% of American Indian and Alaska Native voters supporting Democratic nominee Joe Biden.[381] In particular, the Navajo Reservation, which spans a large quadrant of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, delivered up to 97% of their votes per precinct to Biden,[382] while overall support for Biden was between 60 and 90% on the Reservation.[383] Biden also posted large turnout among Havasupai, Hopi, and Tohono O'odham peoples,[384] delivering a large win in New Mexico and flipping Arizona.\n In Montana, while the state went for Trump overall, Biden won counties overlapping reservations of the Blackfeet, Fort Belknap, Crow and Northern Cheyenne.[385] The same pattern held in South Dakota, with most of the counties overlapping the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux and Crow Creek tribes going for Biden. For example, in Oglala Lakota County, which overlaps with the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Biden won 88% of the vote.[385]\n Trump's strongest performance among Native tribes was with the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, where he won a strong majority in Robeson County and flipped Scotland County from blue to red.[386] Trump had campaigned in Lumberton, in Robeson County, and had promised the Lumbees federal recognition.[386]\n Although polls generally predicted the Biden victory, the national polls overestimated him by three to four points, and some state polling was even further from the actual result and greater than 2016's error (one or two points).[387] The numbers represented the highest level of error since the 1980 presidential election.[388] This polling overestimation also applied in several Senate races, where the Democrats underperformed by about five points relative to the polls,[389] as well as the House elections, where Republicans gained seats instead of losing as polls predicted. Most pollsters underestimated support for Trump in several key battleground states, including Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin. The discrepancy between poll predictions and the actual result persisted from the 2016 election despite pollsters' attempts to fix problems with polling in 2016, in which they underestimated the Republican vote in several states. The imprecise polls led to changes in campaigning and fundraising decisions for both Democrats and Republicans.[387]\n According to The New York Times, polling misses have been attributed to, among other issues, reduced average response to polling; the relative difficulty to poll certain types of voters; and pandemic-related problems, such as a theory which suggests Democrats were less willing to vote in person on Election Day than Republicans for fear of contracting COVID-19.[387] According to CNN, research presented to the American Association for Public Opinion Research indicated one of the primary problems was an inability by pollsters to include a certain segment of Trump supporters, either due to inaccessibility or lack of participation.[388] New Statesman data journalist Ben Walker pointed to Hispanics as a historically difficult group to poll accurately, leading to pollsters underestimating the level of Trump support within the demographic group.[390] Election analyst Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight wrote that the polling error was completely normal by historical standards and disputes the narrative that polls were wrong.[391]\n Election night, November 3, ended without a clear winner, as many state results were too close to call and millions of votes remained uncounted, including in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.[392] Results were delayed in these states due to local rules on counting mail-in ballots.[393] In a victory declared after midnight, Trump won the swing state of Florida by over three percentage points, an increase from his 1.2 percentage point margin in 2016, having seen significant gains in support among the Latino community in Miami-Dade County.[394]\n Shortly after 12:30\u00a0a.m.\u00a0EST, Biden made a short speech in which he urged his supporters to be patient while the votes are counted, and said he believed he was \"on track to win this election\".[395][396] Shortly before 2:30\u00a0a.m.\u00a0EST, Trump made a speech to a roomful of supporters, falsely asserting that he had won the election and calling for a stop to all vote counting, saying that continued counting was \"a fraud on the American people\" and \"we will be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"[397][398] The Biden campaign denounced these attempts, claiming the Trump campaign was engaging in a \"naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens\".[399]\n In Pennsylvania, where the counting of mail-in ballots began on election night, Trump declared victory on November\u00a04 with a lead of 675,000 votes, despite more than a million ballots remaining uncounted. Trump also declared victory in North Carolina and Georgia, despite many ballots being uncounted.[400] At 11:20\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EST on election night, Fox News projected Biden would win Arizona, with the Associated Press making the same call at 2:50\u00a0a.m.\u00a0EST on November 4;[401][402] several other media outlets concluded the state was too close to call.[403][404] By the evening of November 4, the Associated Press reported that Biden had secured 264 electoral votes by winning Michigan and Wisconsin, with Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada remaining uncalled.[405] Biden had a 1% lead in Nevada[406] and maintained a 2.3% lead in Arizona by November 5,[407] needing only to win Nevada and Arizona or to win Pennsylvania to obtain the necessary 270 electoral votes.[405]\n Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts[408] attributed this to several factors, including a \"red mirage\" of early results being counted in relatively thinly populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, encouraging his supporters instead to vote in person. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early blue shift giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.[409][410][411]\n On November 5, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump campaign to stop vote-counting in Pennsylvania. The Trump campaign had alleged that its observers were not given access to observe the vote, but its lawyers admitted during the hearing that its observers were already present in the vote-counting room.[412] Also that day, a state judge dismissed another lawsuit by the Trump campaign which alleged that in Georgia, late-arriving ballots were counted. The judge ruled no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late.[413] Meanwhile, a state judge in Michigan dismissed the Trump campaign's lawsuit requesting a pause in vote-counting to allow access to observers, as the judge noted that vote-counting had already finished in Michigan.[414] That judge also noted the official complaint did not state \"why\", \"when, where, or by whom\" an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot-counting in Michigan.[415]\n On November 6, Biden assumed leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia as the states continued to count ballots, and absentee votes in those states heavily favored Biden.[416] Due to the slim margin between Biden and Trump in the state, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced on November\u00a06 that a recount would be held in Georgia. At that point, Georgia had not seen \"any widespread irregularities\" in this election, according to the voting system manager of the state, Gabriel Sterling.[417]\n Also, on November 6, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued an order requiring officials in Pennsylvania to segregate late-arriving ballots, amid a dispute as to whether the state's Supreme Court validly ordered a 3-day extension of the deadline for mail-in ballots to arrive.[418] Several Republican attorneys general filed amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court in subsequent days agreeing with the Pennsylvania Republican Party's view that only the state legislature could change the voting deadline.[419]\n By November 7, several prominent Republicans had publicly denounced Trump's claims of electoral fraud, saying they were unsubstantiated, baseless or without evidence, damaging to the election process, undermining democracy and dangerous to political stability while others supported his demand of transparency.[420] According to CNN, people close to Donald Trump, such as his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and his wife Melania Trump, urged him to accept his defeat. While Donald Trump privately acknowledged the outcome of the presidential election, he nonetheless encouraged his legal team to continue pursuing legal challenges.[421] Trump expected to win the election in Arizona, but when Fox News declared Biden the victor of the state, Trump became furious and claimed the result was due to fraud.[422]\nTrump and his allies suffered approximately 50 legal losses in four weeks after starting their litigation.[423] In view of these legal defeats, Trump began to employ \"a public pressure campaign on state and local Republican officials to manipulate the electoral system on his behalf\".[422][424][425][426]\n Protests against Trump's challenges to the election results occurred in Minneapolis, Portland, New York, and other cities. Police in Minneapolis arrested more than 600 demonstrators for blocking traffic on an interstate highway. In Portland, the National Guard was called out after some protesters smashed windows and threw objects at police.[427] At the same time, groups of Trump supporters gathered outside of election centers in Phoenix, Detroit, and Philadelphia, shouting objections to counts that showed Biden leading or gaining ground.[427] In Arizona, where Biden's lead was shrinking as more results were reported, the pro-Trump protesters mostly demanded that all remaining votes be counted, while in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Trump's lead shrank and disappeared altogether as more results were reported, they called for the count to be stopped.[428]\n Trump and a variety of his surrogates and supporters made a series of observably false claims that the election was fraudulent. Claims that substantial fraud was committed have been repeatedly debunked.[431][432] On November 9\u00a0and 10, The New York Times called the offices of top election officials in every state; all 45 of those who responded said there was no evidence of fraud. Some described the election as remarkably successful considering the coronavirus pandemic, the record turnout, and the unprecedented number of mailed ballots.[32] On November 12, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a statement calling the 2020 election \"the most secure in American history\" and noting \"[t]here is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\"[34] Trump fired the director of CISA five days later.[433]\n As ballots were still being counted two days after Election Day, Trump falsely asserted that there was \"tremendous corruption and fraud going on\", adding: \"If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.\"[434] Trump has repeatedly claimed that the results of mail-in ballots showing significantly more support for Biden is suspicious.[435] This is a common phenomenon known as the blue shift, since more Democrats than Republicans tend to vote by mail, and mail ballots are counted after Election Day in many states. Leading up to the 2020 election, the effect was predicted to be even greater than usual, as Trump's attacks on mail-in voting may have deterred Republicans from casting mail ballots.[436]\n In early January 2021, Trump falsely and repeatedly claimed that he won every single state in the presidential election \u2013 a 50-state sweep, and a 535 to 3 electoral college victory. On January 2, during his phone call to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State, Trump said, \"As you know, every single state. We won every state; we won every statehouse in the country... But we won every single statehouse.\"[437] Two days later, on January 4, Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Dalton, Georgia, showing his support for Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. During his speech at the rally, Trump again asserted that he won \"every single state\", and \"We win every state, and they're going to have this guy [Biden] be President?\"[438]\n Many claims of purported voter fraud were discovered to be false or misleading. In Fulton County, Georgia, the number of votes affected was 342, with no breakdown of which candidates they were for.[439] A viral video of a Pennsylvania poll worker filling out a ballot was found to be a case of a damaged ballot being replicated to ensure proper counting, while a video claimed to show a man taking ballots illegally to a Detroit counting center was found to be actually depicting a photographer transporting his equipment.[440][441] Another video of a poll watcher being turned away in Philadelphia was found to be real, but the poll watcher had subsequently been allowed inside after a misunderstanding had been resolved.[442] A tweet that went viral claimed 14,000 votes in Wayne County, Michigan, were cast by dead people, but the list of names included was found to be incorrect.[443] The Trump campaign and Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson also claimed a James Blalock had voted in Georgia despite having died in 2006, though his 94-year-old widow had registered and voted as Mrs. James E. Blalock.[444] In Erie, Pennsylvania, a postal worker who claimed the postmaster had instructed postal workers to backdate ballots mailed after Election Day later admitted he had fabricated the claim. Prior to his recantation, Republican senator Lindsey Graham cited the claim in a letter to the Justice Department calling for an investigation, and the worker was praised as a patriot on a GoFundMe page created in his name that raised $136,000.[445]\n Days after Biden had been declared the winner, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asserted without evidence that the Democratic Party was welcoming fraud and illegal voting.[446] Republican former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated on Fox News, \"I think that it is a corrupt, stolen election.\"[447] Appearing at a press conference outside a Philadelphia landscaping business as Biden was being declared the winner, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani asserted without evidence that hundreds of thousands of ballots were questionable.[448] Responding to Giuliani, a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said: \"Many of the claims against the commonwealth have already been dismissed, and repeating these false attacks is reckless. No active lawsuit even alleges, and no evidence presented so far has shown, widespread problems.\"[32]\n One week after the election, Republican Philadelphia city commissioner Al Schmidt said he had not seen any evidence of widespread fraud, stating, \"I have seen the most fantastical things on social media, making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all and see them spread.\" He added that his office had examined a list of dead people who purportedly voted in Philadelphia but \"not a single one of them voted in Philadelphia after they died.\" Trump derided Schmidt, tweeting, \"He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption & dishonesty. We win!\"[449]\n Attorneys who brought accusations of voting fraud or irregularities before judges could not produce actual evidence to support the allegations. In one instance, a Trump attorney sought to have ballot counting halted in Detroit on the basis of a claim by a Republican poll watcher that she had been told by an unidentified person that ballots were being backdated; Michigan Court of Appeals judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed the argument as \"inadmissible hearsay within hearsay\".[450][451] Some senior attorneys at law firms working on Trump's behalf, notably Jones Day, expressed concerns that they were helping to undermine the integrity of American elections by advancing arguments lacking evidence.[452]\n Trump and his lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell repeatedly made the false claim that the Toronto, Ontario-based firm Dominion Voting Systems, which had supplied voting machines for 27 states, was a \"communist\" organization controlled by billionaire George Soros, former Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (who died in 2013), or the Chinese Communist Party, and that the machines had \"stolen\" hundreds of thousands of votes from Trump. The false claims about the company circulated on social media, amplified by more than a dozen tweets or retweets by Trump. The disinformation campaign prompted threats and harassment against Dominion employees.[455]\n A December 2020 poll showed 77% of Republicans believe widespread fraud occurred during the election. 35% of independent voters also said they believe widespread voter fraud took place.[456] Overall, 60% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 34% did not, and 6% were unsure. Another poll taken in late December showed a similar result, with 62% of Americans polled believing Biden was the legitimate winner of the election, while 37% did not.[457] This split in popular opinion remained largely stable, with a January 10, 2021, poll commissioned by ABC News showing 68% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate and 32% did not.[458] These numbers remained largely stagnant, with a June 2021 poll from Monmouth showing 61% believed Biden won fair and square, 32% believed he won due to fraud, and 7% were unsure.[459] More than a year later, public opinion on the matter still remained stagnant, with a poll commissioned by ABC News finding that 65% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 33% believed it was not legitimate, and 2% were unsure. The same poll also found that 72% of Americans thought the people involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, were attacking democracy, while 25% thought they were protecting democracy, and 3% were unsure.[460] A March 2022 poll commissioned by the conservative Rasmussen Reports found that 52% of voters think that it is likely that cheating \"affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\" while 40% of voters believe that it is unlikely. 33% say that cheating was very likely, 19% say it was somewhat likely, 13% say it was somewhat unlikely, and 27% say it was very unlikely.[461]\n Motivated by the myth of widespread fraud, Republican state lawmakers initiated a push to make voting laws more restrictive.[462]\n After the election, the Trump campaign filed several lawsuits in multiple states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.[463] Lawyers and other observers noted the suits were unlikely to have an effect on the outcome. Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt said, \"There's literally nothing that I've seen yet with the meaningful potential to affect the final result.\"[464]\nSome law firms have moved to drop their representation in lawsuits challenging results of the election.[465]\n On December 20, Giuliani filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking them to overturn the results of the Pennsylvania election and direct the state legislature to appoint electors. The Supreme Court was regarded as very unlikely to grant this petition, and even if they did, it would not alter the election outcome, since Biden would still have a majority of Electoral College votes without Pennsylvania.[466] The Court set the deadline for reply briefs from the respondents for January 22, 2021, two days after President Elect Biden's inauguration.[467]\n On December 9, Ken Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas, filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the United States, asking the court to overturn the results in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Attorneys general of seventeen other states also signed onto the lawsuit.[468][469][470] 126 Republicans in the House of Representatives, more than two-thirds of the Republican caucus, signed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit.[471] The suit was rejected by the Supreme Court on December 11.[472][473]\n Early in the morning on November 4, with vote counts still going on in many states, Trump claimed he had won: \"This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election, frankly we did win this election.\"[475] For weeks after the networks had called the election for Biden, Trump refused to acknowledge that Biden had won. Unlike every losing major party presidential candidate before him, Trump was refusing to formally concede, thus breaking with the established precedent of formal concession started in 1896, when William Jennings Bryan sent a congratulatory telegram to President-elect William McKinley.[476] Biden described Trump's refusal as \"an embarrassment\".[477]\n In the wake of the election, the White House ordered government agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team in any way,[478] and the General Services Administration (GSA) refused to formally acknowledge Biden's victory,[479]\n Trump finally acknowledged Biden's victory in a tweet on November 15, although he refused to concede and blamed his loss on fraud, stating: \"He won because the Election was Rigged.\" Trump then tweeted: \"I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.\"[480][481]\n In a June 2021 interview with Sean Hannity, Trump stated that \"we didn't win\" and said that he wished President Biden success in international diplomacy, which Forbes declared as Trump \"[coming] as close as he's ever been to conceding his 2020 election loss.\"[482]\n Although all major media outlets called the election for Biden on November 7, the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), Trump appointee Emily W. Murphy, refused for over two weeks to certify Biden as the president-elect. Without formal GSA certification or \"ascertainment\" of the winner of the election, the official transition process was delayed.[483] On November 23, Murphy acknowledged Biden as the winner and said the Trump administration would begin the formal transition process. Trump said he had instructed his administration to \"do what needs to be done\" but did not concede, and indicated he intended to continue his fight to overturn the election results.[484]\n Both before and after the election, Trump and other Republican leaders publicly considered asking certain Republican-controlled state legislatures to select electors for Trump rather than Biden, even in the event of a Biden victory in those states.[485] In Pennsylvania, a state which Biden won despite its legislature being controlled by Republicans, the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked a federal judge to consider ordering the state legislature to ignore the state's popular vote and select electors for Trump.[486] Legal experts, including New York University law professor Richard Pildes, have said such a strategy would run into numerous legal and political problems, noting that in various battleground states, Democratic Party members elected to statewide offices would thwart such efforts,[487] and ultimately Congress likely would not accept the votes of legislatively appointed electors over those appointed based on the election results.[488] Law professor Lawrence Lessig noted that while the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine how electors are selected, including the power to directly appoint them, Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 gives Congress the power to determine when electors must be appointed, which they have designated to be Election Day, meaning that legislatures cannot change how electors are appointed for an election after this date.[489] In modern times, most states have used a popular vote within their state as the determining factor in who gets all the state's electors,[487] and changing election rules after an election has been conducted could also violate the Constitution's Due Process Clause.[490]\n In November, Trump focused his efforts on trying to delay vote certifications at the county and state level.[491] On December 2, Trump posted a 46-minute video to his social media in which he repeated his baseless claims that the election was \"rigged\" and fraudulent and called for either the state legislatures or the courts to overturn the results of the election and allow him to stay in office.[492] He continued to apply pressure to elected Republicans in Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania in an unprecedented attempt to overturn the election result. Some commentators have characterized Trump's actions as an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat or self-coup.[46]\n On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, who was previously among those who would not recognize the election results, publicly accepted Biden's win, saying, \"Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.\"[493]\n Multiple news media outlets reported that at a December 18 meeting in the White House, there was discussion of Michael Flynn's suggestion to overturn the election by invoking martial law and rerunning the election in several swing states under military supervision.[494][495][496] Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville later issued a joint statement saying: \"There is no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of an American election.\"[497] In a December 20 tweet, Trump dismissed the accusations of wanting to declare martial law as \"fake news\".[498]\n In a December 21 news conference, outgoing Attorney General William Barr disavowed several actions reportedly being considered by Trump, including seizing voting machines, appointing a special counsel to investigate voter fraud, and appointing one to investigate Hunter Biden.[499]\n On January 6, 2021, shortly after a rally held by Trump where he continued to press false claims of election fraud, a crowd of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, interrupting the Joint session of the United States Congress where the official Electoral College ballots were being certified. The crowd caused widespread damage to the Capitol and forced lawmakers to evacuate the chambers where debate was occurring. As part of an organized effort by Republican lawmakers to challenge the results in close states, the House and the Senate were meeting separately to debate the results of Arizona's election and accepting the electoral college ballots submitted. Several other challenges were also planned. After the interruption, while leaders of both parties, including Vice President Pence, Speaker Pelosi, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell, all denounced the disruption and called on lawmakers to confirm the results, several Republicans pressed forward with their challenges, though they were unsuccessful in changing any of the electoral college results, and the official vote was certified in the early morning hours of January 7.[500][501][502]\n As the Trump campaign's lawsuits were repeatedly rejected in court, Trump personally communicated with Republican local and state officials in at least three states, including state legislators, attorneys general, and governors who had supported him in the general election and continued to support him. He pressured them to overturn the election results in their states by recounting votes, throwing out certain votes, or getting the state legislature to replace the elected Democratic slate of Electoral College members with a Republican slate of electors chosen by the legislature.[503] In late November, he personally phoned Republican members of two county electoral boards in Michigan, trying to get them to reverse their certification of the result in their county.[504] He then invited members of the Michigan state legislature to the White House, where they declined his suggestion that they choose a new slate of electors.[505] He repeatedly spoke to the Republican governor of Georgia and the secretary of state, demanding that they reverse their state's election results, threatening them with political retaliation when they did not, strongly criticizing them in speeches and tweets, and demanding that the governor resign.[506]\n During the first week of December, Trump twice phoned the speaker of the Pennsylvania state House of Representatives, urging him to appoint a replacement slate of electors; the speaker said he did not have that power but later joined in a letter encouraging the state's representatives in Congress to dispute the results.[503] On January 4 The Washington Post reported that in a phone call on January 2, Trump pressured Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's result, telling him \"I just want to find 11,780 votes\" and threatening him with legal action if he did not cooperate.[41][507] On January 4, 2021, Democratic congressional leaders, believing Trump \"engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes\", requested the FBI to investigate the incident.[508] In addition, while some House Republicans tried to defend Trump's Georgia call, Democrats began drafting a censure resolution.[509] Two months later The Washington Post acknowledged that they had originally used quotes not actually said by Trump, and added a correction to the article.[510] Also on January 2, 2021, Trump took part in a mass phone call with nearly 300 state legislators from Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in which he urged them to \"decertify\" the election results in their states.[511]\n On November 11, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ordered a statewide hand recount of the vote in addition to the normal audit process. At the time, Biden held a lead of 14,112 votes, or 0.3% in the state.[512] The audit was concluded on November 19 and affirmed Biden's lead by 12,670 votes. The change in the count was due to a number of human errors, including memory cards that did not upload properly to the state servers, and was not attributable to any fraud in the original tally.[513] After certifying the results Republican Governor Brian Kemp called for another hand audit, demanding to compare signatures on absentee ballot requests to actual ballots, despite the fact that this request was impossible,[514] as signatures on mail-in ballot applications and envelopes are checked when they are originally received by election offices, and that ballots are thereafter separated from envelopes to ensure the secrecy of the ballot.[515][516] The Trump campaign requested a machine recount, which was estimated to cost taxpayers $200,000 in one Georgia county alone.[517] This recount reaffirmed Biden's victory in the state for the third time.[514]\n Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn Biden's win in Georgia through litigation; suits by the Trump campaign and allies were rejected by both the Georgia Supreme Court[518] and by federal courts.[514][519] Trump also sought to overturn Biden's win by pressuring Kemp to call a special session of the Georgia General Assembly so state legislators could override the Georgia election results and appoint a pro-Trump slate of electors, an entreaty rebuffed by Kemp.[520]\n On November 18, the Trump campaign wired $3\u00a0million to pay for partial recounts in Milwaukee County and Dane County, Wisconsin, where Milwaukee and Madison, the two largest cities in the state and Democratic strongholds, are located.[521] During the recount, Milwaukee County election commissioner Tim Posnanski said several Republican observers were breaking rules by posing as independents. The recount started November 20 and concluded on November 29, increasing Biden's lead by 87 votes.[522][523]\n The presidential electors met in the state capitol of each state and in the District of Columbia on December 14, 2020, and formalized Biden's victory, casting 306 votes for Biden/Harris and 232 votes for Trump/Pence.[524][525] Unlike the 2016 election, there were no faithless electors.[526] In six swing states won by Biden, groups of self-appointed Republican \"alternate electors\" met on the same day to vote for Trump. These alternate slates were not signed by the governors of the states they claim to represent, did not have the backing of any state legislature, and have no legal status.[525][527]\n Even after the casting of the electoral votes and rejection of his lawsuits seeking to overturn the election by at least 86 judges,[525] Trump refused to concede defeat.[524][525][528] In a speech following the Electoral College vote, Biden praised the resiliency of U.S. democratic institutions and the high election turnout (calling it \"one of the most amazing demonstrations of civic duty we've ever seen in our country\") and called for national unity. Biden also condemned Trump, and those who backed his efforts to subvert the election outcome, for adopting a stance \"so extreme that we've never seen it before\u00a0\u2013 a position that refused to respect the will of the people, refused to respect the rule of law and refused to honor our Constitution\" and for exposing state election workers and officials to \"political pressure, verbal abuse and even threats of physical violence\" that was \"simply unconscionable\".[529][528]\n The 117th United States Congress first convened on January 3, 2021, and was scheduled to count and certify the Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021. There were 222 Democrats and 212 Republicans in the House; there were 51 Republicans, 46 Democrats, and two independents in the Senate. Several Republican members of the House and Senate said they would raise objections to the reported count in several states,[530][531] meeting the requirement that if a member from each body objects, the two houses must meet separately to discuss whether to accept the certified state vote.[532][533] A statement from the vice president's office said Pence welcomes the plan by Republicans to \"raise objections and bring forward evidence\" challenging the election results.[534]\n On December 28, 2020, Representative Louie Gohmert filed a lawsuit in Texas challenging the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, claiming Vice President Pence has the power and ability to unilaterally decide which slates of electoral votes get counted.[535][536] The case was dismissed on January 1, 2021, for lack of both standing and jurisdiction.[537][538] The plaintiffs filed an appeal, and the appeal was dismissed by a three-judge panel of the appeals court the next day.[539]\n As vice president, Pence was due to preside over the January 6, 2021, congressional session to count the electoral votes, which is normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event. In January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election, demanding both in public and in private that Pence use his position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump and Pence the winners of the election.[540] Pence demurred that the law does not give him that power.[541]\n Starting in December, Trump called for his supporters to stage a massive protest in Washington, D.C. on January\u00a06 to argue against certification of the electoral vote, using tweets such as \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"[542] D.C. police were concerned, and the National Guard was alerted because several rallies in December had turned violent.[543] On January 6, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, stopping the count of the votes and prompting an evacuation of press and lawmakers.[544] The group entered the House and Senate chambers and vandalized offices. Five people died as a result of the events in the Capitol: one person was shot by police, one Capitol Police officer died from a stroke after physically engaging with rioters,[545] one person died of a heart attack, another of a stroke, and the final person's death is still under investigation. Trump has been accused of inciting the violence with his rhetoric,[546] an accusation that was reinforced with an article of impeachment filed on January 13 for \"incitement of insurrection\".[547]\n Congress reconvened that same night, after the Capitol was cleared of trespassers. The Senate resumed its session at around 8:00\u00a0p.m. on January\u00a06 to finish debating the objection to the Arizona electors. Objections to the Pennsylvania electors were also considered. The joint session completed its work shortly before 4:00\u00a0a.m. on Thursday, January 7, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[548][549][550] Several commentators viewed the attack on the Capitol Building as an indicator of increased political destabilization in the country that could lead to a spike of political violence in future elections, ranging from domestic terrorism to a Second American Civil War.[551][552][553][554][555][556]\n On January 11, 2021, Representative Cori Bush filed a resolution calling for the possible expulsion of more than 100 Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives who voted against certifying results of the presidential election, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said the Senate Ethics Committee \"must consider the expulsion, or censure and punishment, of Senators Cruz, Hawley, and perhaps others.\"[557]\n On March 31, 2021, the Republican caucus of the Arizona State Senate hired several outside firms to examine the results of the presidential and senatorial elections in Maricopa County, where Biden had won by a large margin.[558] There had been three previous audits and recounts of that county's results.[559] The examination was initially funded by $150,000 from the State Senate operating budget; additional funding was to come from outside sources.[560] In July the lead firm conducting the review released a summary of major donors, indicating $5.7 million was raised from five groups associated with individuals who had cast doubt on the presidential election.[561] The audit began on April 22, 2021, and was expected to last 60 days.[562] The investigation was still ongoing in August when a judge issued an order for the release of documents.[563] On September 24, a preliminary release of the audit claimed to have found minor discrepancies in the original, state-certified count, which had actually widened Biden's margin by 360 votes.[564]\n On May 10, 2021, over 120 retired U.S. generals and admirals published an open letter alleging that there had been \"election irregularities\", suggesting that the election had not been \"fair and honest\" and did not \"accurately reflect the \"will of the people\", and arguing for tighter restrictions on voting.\"[565] On May 12, 2021, U.S. Representative Liz Cheney was removed from her party leadership role as Chair of the House Republican Conference, partially for continuing to assert that the election had been fair and that the election results were final.[566][567][568]\n Well into Biden's presidency, Trump continues to insist that he had actually won the 2020 election.[569] As of August 2021, surveys found that a majority of Republicans believe it.[570] A widespread rumor predicted that Trump would be somehow reinstated to the presidency in August 2021, although the predicted date of August 13 passed without incident.[571]\n Legend[572]\n Total television viewers8:00 to 11:00\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EST\n Total cable TV viewers6:00\u00a0p.m. to 3:00\u00a0a.m.\u00a0EST\n Television viewers 25 to 548:00 to 11:00\u00a0p.m.\u00a0EST\n Cable TV viewers 25 to 546:00\u00a0p.m. to 3:00\u00a0a.m.\u00a0EST\n \n",

For this analysis, we surveyed U.S. adults online and verified their turnout in the three general elections using commercial voter files that aggregate official state turnout records. Panelists for whom a record of voting was located are considered validated voters; all others are presumed not to have voted. We surveyed 11,818 U.S. adults online in November 2020, 10,640 adults in November 2018 and 4,183 adults in November and December 2016. The surveys were supplemented with measures taken from annual recruitment and profile surveys conducted in 2018 and 2020. Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel recruited through national, random sampling of telephone numbers or, since 2018, residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The surveys are weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education, turnout and vote choice in the three elections, and many other characteristics. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.  Here are the questions used for this report and its methodology. The 2020 presidential election was historic in many ways. Amid a global pandemic, with unprecedented changes in how Americans voted, voter turnout rose 7 percentage points over 2016, resulting in a total of 66% of U.S. adult citizens casting a ballot in the 2020 election. Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and had a 4-point margin in the popular vote. While Biden\u2019s popular vote differential was an improvement over Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 2-point advantage, it was not as resounding as congressional Democrats\u2019 9-point advantage over Republicans in votes cast in the 2018 elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. Members of Pew Research Center\u2019s nationally representative American Trends Panel were matched to public voting records from three national commercial voter files in an attempt to find a record for voting in the 2020 election. Validated voters are citizens who told us in a post-election survey that they voted in the 2020 general election and have a record for voting in a commercial voter file. Nonvoters are citizens who were not found to have a record of voting in any of the voter files or told us they did not vote. A new analysis of validated 2020 voters from Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel examines change and continuity in the electorate, both of which contributed to Biden\u2019s victory. It looks at how new voters and voters who turned out in one or both previous elections voted in the 2020 presidential election and offers a detailed portrait of the demographic composition and vote choices of the 2020 electorate. It also provides a comparison with findings from our previous studies of the 2016 and 2018 electorates. A number of factors determined the composition of the 2020 electorate and explain how it delivered Biden a victory. Among those who voted for Clinton and Trump in 2016, similar shares of each \u2013 about nine-in-ten \u2013 also turned out in 2020, and the vast majority remained loyal to the same party in the 2020 presidential contest. These voters formed substantial bases of support for both Biden and Trump. Overall, there were shifts in presidential candidate support among some key groups between 2016 and 2020, notably suburban voters and independents. On balance, these shifts helped Biden a little more than Trump. Overall, one-in-four 2020 voters (25%) had not voted in 2016. About a quarter of these (6% of all 2020 voters) showed up two years later \u2013 in 2018 \u2013 to cast ballots in the highest-turnout midterm election in decades. Those who voted in 2018 but not in 2016 backed Biden over Trump in the 2020 election by about two-to-one (62% to 36%). Both Trump and Biden were able to bring new voters into the political process in 2020. The 19% of 2020 voters who did not vote in 2016 or 2018 split roughly evenly between the two candidates (49% Biden vs. 47% Trump). However, as with voters overall, there was a substantial age divide within this group. Among those under age 30 who voted in 2020 but not in either of the two previous elections, Biden led 59% to 33%, while Trump won among new or irregular voters ages 30 and older by 55% to 42%. Younger voters also made up an outsize share of these voters: Those under age 30 made up 38% of new or irregular 2020 voters, though they represented just 15% of all 2020 voters. One somewhat unusual aspect of the 2016 election was the relatively high share of voters (nearly 6%) who voted for one of the third-party candidates (mostly the Libertarian and Green Party nominees), a fact many observers attributed to the relative unpopularity of both major party candidates. By comparison, just 2% of voters chose a third-party candidate in 2020. Overall, third-party 2016 voters who turned out in 2020 voted 53%-36% for Biden over Trump, with 10% opting for a third-party candidate. Among the 5% of Republicans who voted third-party in 2016 and voted in 2020, a majority (70%) supported Trump in 2020, but 18% backed Biden. Among the 5% of Democrats who voted third-party in 2016 and voted in 2020, just 8% supported Trump in 2020 while 85% voted for Biden. Here are some of the other key findings from the analysis: This analysis is based on a survey of 11,818 members of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel conducted Nov. 12-17, 2020, shortly after the general election. It also draws on surveys conducted among 10,640 panelists from Nov. 7-16, 2018, after the midterm election that year and 4,183 panelists from Nov. 29 to Dec. 12, 2016, after the general election. Researchers attempted to match the panelists to three different\u00a0commercial voter files\u00a0that contain official records of voter registration and turnout for 2016, 2018 and 2020. (For more details, see Methodology.) This study marries official turnout records with a post-election survey among a large, ongoing survey panel, with the goal of improving the accuracy of the results compared with relying on self-reported turnout alone. The survey panel also makes it possible to examine change in turnout and vote preference over time among many of the same individuals. This analysis joins a growing body of research seeking to achieve a more accurate assessment of the 2020 election, each based on somewhat different sources of data.2 Different methods and data sources have unique strengths and weaknesses, meaning that specific estimates are likely to vary among the studies and no single resource can be considered definitive. The 2020 election featured continuity in the voting patterns of major demographic and political groups in the population, but there were a few important shifts. The gender gap in the 2020 election was narrower than it had been in 2016 as Democrats made gains among men and Republicans made gains among women. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump won men by 11 percentage points (52% to 41%) while Hillary Clinton won women by 15 points (54% to 39%). In the 2018 election, Democrats substantially narrowed the gap with men (50% of men voted for Democratic candidates, 48% for Republican candidates) while maintaining an 18-point lead among women. In the 2020 election, men again divided nearly evenly (50% Trump, 48% Biden), while Biden\u2019s advantage narrowed to 11 points among women (55% to 44%). Similarly, as Biden increased his level of support among White men in the 2020 election relative to Clinton\u2019s in 2016, Trump gained among White women, which had the effect of further narrowing the gender gap among White voters. In 2016, Trump won White men by 30 points (62% to 32%). That gap narrowed to a 17-point margin for Trump in 2020 (57% to 40%). White women, a group sometimes categorized as swing voters and who broke nearly evenly in 2016 (47% for Trump to 45% for Clinton), favored him in 2020 (53% to 46%). Biden received the support of 92% of Black voters, nearly the same as Clinton received in 2016 and Democratic candidates for the U.S. House received in 2018. While Biden took a 59% majority of the Hispanic vote, Trump (with 38%) gained significantly over the level of support Republican candidates for the House received in 2018 (25%). To be sure, Hispanic voters are not a monolith; there is substantial diversity within the Hispanic electorate. One noteworthy feature of the 2020 election was the wide education gap among Hispanic voters. In 2020, Biden won college-educated Hispanic voters 69% to 30%. At the same time, Biden\u2019s advantage over Trump among Hispanic voters who did not have a college degree was far narrower (55% to 41%). One of the most pivotal groups in the 2016 election was White voters without a four-year college degree, who were critical to Trump\u2019s electoral college victory that year (nationally, he won them by a wide 36-point margin in 2016, 64% to 28%). Prior to 2016, differences in candidate preferences by education were typically much smaller than they were that year. In 2020, Trump won 65% of White non-college voters \u2013 nearly identical to his 2016 share \u2013 even as Biden outperformed Clinton among this group (33% of White non-college voters backed Biden, up from the 28% of this group Clinton won in 2016). At the same time, White voters with a college degree or higher supported Biden by roughly the same margin they had backed Clinton in 2016. Trump\u2019s stronghold among White men without a four-year college degree loosened somewhat in 2020. While he still won this group by a little more than two-to one (66% to Biden\u2019s 31%), that 35 percentage point gap is notably smaller than the 50-point gap in the 2016 election, when 73% of White men without a college degree supported Trump, compared with 23% who supported Clinton. Meanwhile, White men with a four-year college degree have become increasingly supportive of Democratic candidates, breaking close to evenly in 2016 (47% for Clinton, 44% for Trump) but supporting Biden by a 10-point margin in 2020. At the same time, Trump\u2019s vote share among White women without a college degree grew slightly between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. In 2016, White, non-college women supported Trump by a margin of 56% to 33%. By 2020, Trump\u2019s vote share rose to 64% among this group compared with 35% supporting Biden. Among white women with a college degree, support for Biden was on par with support for Clinton in 2016 (59%-40% in 2020). Biden and Trump benefited from similar levels of party loyalty in 2020, with Trump receiving 92% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Biden getting 94% among Democrats and Democratic leaners. Comparable levels of support for each candidate were seen among Democrats (95% for Biden) and Republicans (94% for Trump), not including leaners. Among independents and those who affiliated with other parties, Biden led Trump by 52%-43%. Ideological divisions within the parties were also apparent in the vote, with both Trump and Biden doing better among the ideological core of their parties. Trump received the votes of 97% of conservative Republicans and leaners but a smaller majority (79%) of Republicans who describe themselves as moderate or liberal. Biden took 98% of the vote among liberal Democrats and leaners and 91% among those who are moderate or conservative. A yawning age gap in voter support \u2013 a pattern that emerged in the 2004 presidential election for the first time since 1972 \u2013 continues to be evident, with voters under 30 favoring Joe Biden by 24 percentage points (Biden 59%, Trump 35%). Perhaps reflecting the enduring impact of this long-term age gap, voters ages 30 to 49 were also solidly in the Democratic candidate\u2019s camp in 2020, favoring Biden by 12 points (55%-43%), similar to Clinton\u2019s share among this age group. By contrast, older age groups divided fairly evenly between Biden and Trump, a result not too different from 2016. These patterns also are apparent when the lens is shifted to birth cohorts, or generations \u2013 groups of voters who share birth years and perhaps formative political experiences in common, such as the popularity of the president at the time they were first eligible to vote. Voters in the youngest adult generations today \u2013 Generation Z (those ages 18 to 23 in 2020) and the Millennial generation (ages 24 to 39 in 2020) \u2013 favored Biden over Trump by a margin of 20 percentage points, though Trump gained 8 points among Millennials compared with his 2016 performance. Generation Xers, those ages 40 to 55 in 2020, divided relatively evenly (51% to 48%), as did Baby Boomers. Only among members of the Silent Generation, ages 75 to 92 in 2020, was Trump clearly favored (by 58%-42%). Notably, Boomers and Silents (and the very small number of voters from the Greatest Generation) made up less than half of the electorate in 2020 (44%), compared with just over half in both 2016 and 2018. The political split between America\u2019s rural areas and its suburban and urban locales remained substantial in 2020. Biden did considerably better among suburban voters in 2020 than Clinton did in 2016 (54% for Biden, 45% for Clinton). By contrast, Trump garnered the support of 65% of rural voters, including 71% of White rural voters; the latter represented an increase over the 62% he received among this group in 2016. Biden received a solid majority of votes among urban residents (66% overall), but Trump gained among urbanites relative to his performance in 2016 (33% in 2020, 24% in 2016). Voters in 2020 sorted along religious lines in ways consistent with recent elections. Protestants constituted nearly half of all voters (46%), as they did in 2016. Within the Protestant tradition, White evangelicals accounted for 19% of all voters, but a much higher share of Trump\u2019s voters (34%). Without such broad support for Trump among White evangelicals, Biden would have beaten him by more than 20 points. White non-evangelical Protestants voted for Trump over Biden by a 14-point margin (57%-43%), while Black Protestants were an overwhelmingly Democratic group (91% voted for Biden). Biden, by contrast, drew strong support from religiously unaffiliated voters \u2013 atheists, agnostics, and those who say their religion is \u201cnothing in particular.\u201d Together, these voters made up 25% of voters, which is a slightly larger share of the total electorate than White evangelicals (19%). But support for Biden among the unaffiliated was not quite as lopsided as Trump\u2019s support among White evangelicals (a 45-point margin for Biden among the unaffiliated vs. a 69-point margin for Trump among White evangelicals). Without the religiously unaffiliated, Trump would have had a 9-point popular vote margin over Biden. White non-Hispanic Catholics were more supportive of Biden (at 42%) than they had been of Clinton in 2016 (31%), but Trump still captured a solid majority of their votes (57%). White Catholics made up 14% of all voters. As was the case in the 2016 and 2018 elections, the Democratic voting coalition in 2020 looked quite different from the Republican coalition in several respects. Overall, Biden voters were younger, more racially and ethnically diverse, and less likely to live in rural areas than Trump voters. In 2020, 85% of voters who cast a ballot for Trump were White non-Hispanic; this compares with just 61% of Biden voters. These differences are roughly consistent with the share of White voters in each party\u2019s coalition in 2016. Nearly two-in-ten voters who cast a ballot for Biden in the 2020 election (19%) were Black, identical to the share of Clinton voters in 2016 who were Black. That is significantly higher than the share of Trump voters who were Black (2%). The community profiles of Trump and Biden voters are similar in some fundamental ways to the previous two elections \u2013 but more voters who cast ballots for Biden in 2020 say they live in a suburban area compared with Clinton\u2019s 2016 voters. Overall, urban voters continue to constitute a larger share of the Democratic coalition compared with the Republican coalition. And rural voters remain a significantly larger portion of the Republican electorate. However, when comparing Clinton\u2019s voters with Biden\u2019s, there are some significant shifts. In 2016, about half of Clinton\u2019s voters described their communities as suburban (48%), while 32% said they were from an urban area and 19% were from a rural area. In 2020, suburban voters made up a majority of Biden\u2019s coalition (55%); 28% of his voters said they lived in urban areas and 17% were from rural areas. In 2020, 31% of Trump voters had at least a four-year college degree \u2013 similar to the share of Trump voters who had a college degree in 2016. Far more Trump voters (roughly 70% in each presidential election) did not have a four-year college degree. The Democratic electorate is more evenly divided when it comes to education. In 2020, 46% of Biden voters had at least a college degree; 53% did not have a degree. As was the case in 2016, White voters without a four-year college degree made up a considerably larger share of GOP voters (58%) than Democratic voters (27%). At the same time, White voters with a college degree made up a larger share of Biden voters (34%) than Trump voters (27%). In 2020, the age profiles of Democratic and Republican voters looked largely similar to 2016. Younger adults continue to make up a larger share of Democratic voters compared with Republican voters. For example, in 2020, nearly half of Biden voters (49%) were younger than 50; that compares with 39% of Trump voters in 2020. Protestants made up a majority of those voting Republican in 2020, just as they did in 2016. Overall, 58% of Trump voters were Protestant, compared with just 35% of Biden voters. White evangelical Protestants, in particular, remained a critical part of the Republican voting coalition, making up 34% of Trump\u2019s voters but just 6% of Biden\u2019s. Catholics made up similar shares of Biden and Trump voters (19% and 22%, respectively); in 2016, Catholics made up a slightly higher share of Trump voters compared with Clinton voters (23% vs. 18%). Voters who were unaffiliated with any religious tradition (atheists, agnostics and those who describe themselves as \u201cnothing in particular\u201d) made up 35% of Biden voters but just 14% of Trump voters in 2020. The 2020 election brought a huge change in howAmericans cast their ballots. As some states looked to adapt to challenges in administering elections amid the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of voters were offered expanded access to absentee and vote-by-mail options in the 2020 election. As a result, a record number of voters said they cast their ballots this way (46%). And smaller shares of voters said they either voted in person on Election Day (27%) or in person before Election Day (27%). A majority of absentee voters said they had previously voted this way before the 2020 election (56%). Still, a sizable share (43%) said the November election was the first time they had cast an absentee or mail ballot. Sizable shares of voters across racial and ethnic subgroups cast absentee or mail-in ballots in the 2020 election \u2013 though there are some differences in voting methods when comparing across groups. White voters were most likely to say they voted in person on Election Day (30%). Comparably smaller shares of Black (20%) and Hispanic voters (18%) said the same. Black voters were more likely than White or Hispanic voters to say they cast their ballot in person before Election Day (42% of Black voters, vs. 27% of Hispanic voters and 25% of White voters). Voters ages 65 and older stand out in their voting behavior: 55% say they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election \u2013 13 percentage points higher than the share of adults under 65 who cast a ballot by mail. Urban and suburban voters were considerably more likely than rural voters to say they cast their ballot by mail (50% of urban and suburban vs. 35% of rural voters). In contrast, rural voters were more likely to report voting in person on Election Day. A majority of Biden voters said they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election (58%). By contrast, about a third of Trump voters (32%) voted by mail. Roughly two-thirds of Trump voters (68%) said they voted in person, either on (38%) or before (30%) Election Day.\u00a0 Reflecting these differences, Trump performed much better among voters who cast their ballots in person on Election Day (65% for Trump vs. 33% for Biden). These shares were reversed among absentee and mail-in voters: 65% of absentee voters said they voted for Biden, compared with 33% who voted for Trump. Preferences were more evenly divided among those who cast their ballots in person ahead of Election Day: 52% voted for Trump while 47% voted for Biden. The 2020 general election featured the highest rate of voter turnout in more than a century, with 66% of eligible adults casting a ballot for president. All members of the American Trends Panel who took the 2020 post-election survey \u2013 whether they voted or not \u2013 were asked which candidate they preferred in the race for president. Nonvoters \u2013 citizens for whom no record of turnout could be located or who told us they did not vote \u2013 preferred Joe Biden over Donald Trump by 15 percentage points, 50% to 35%, compared with Biden\u2019s 4-point overall advantage among voters. Voters were nearly evenly divided on party affiliation, with 50% identifying or leaning Democratic and 48% identifying or leaning Republican, similar to the 51%-48% split in 2016. Nonvoters in 2020 were more closely divided on partisanship than they were in 2016. Among nonvoters in 2020, 46% were Democrats or leaned Democratic, while 41% were Republicans or leaned Republican. A majority of nonvoters in 2016 (55%) were Democrats or Democratic leaners, compared with about four-in-ten (41%) who were Republicans or leaned toward the Republican Party. Despite notable changes in the demographics of the two candidates\u2019 coalitions, the demographic composition of the electorate as a whole in 2020 did not differ much from that of 2016. Although turnout was strong, stark demographic differences between voters and nonvoters similar to those seen in past U.S. elections were present in 2020, a pattern familiar to political observers. Voters as a group were considerably older than nonvoters. Adults younger than 50 made up 45% of all voters but 68% of nonvoters \u2013 nearly identical to the pattern seen in 2016. But generational change in the electorate was quite apparent. Very few members of Gen Z (born 1997 and later) were eligible to vote in the 2016 electorate, and they made up just 1% of all voters that year. In 2020, they were 8% of the total, though their lower rate of turnout compared with older age cohorts is reflected in the fact that they were 15% of eligible nonvoters. At the other end of the generational spectrum, members of the Silent and Greatest generations (born 1945 and earlier) fell from 16% of all voters in 2016 to just 8% in 2020, but their turnout rates remained among the highest of all generations.\u00a0 Turnout differences by race and ethnicity persisted as well. White non-Hispanic adults were 72% of voters in 2020 but just 55% of nonvoting citizens. Black Americans made up 11% of voters, but a slightly larger share (14%) of nonvoting citizens, and Hispanic adults were 10% of voters but 20% of nonvoting citizens. Asian Americans (a relatively small but fast-growing group in the U.S.) made up 4% of voters and an identical share of nonvoting citizens (note: nonvoters in this analysis do not include noncitizens). Some of the largest differences between voters and nonvoters are seen on education and income. College graduates made up 39% of all voters in 2020 (about the same as in 2016) but only 17% of nonvoters. Adults with a high school education or less were 29% of all voters but half of nonvoters.

    "https://www.bbc.com/news/63061930": "President Jair Bolsonaro has said that the voting machines used across Brazil are open to fraud - with echoes of Donald Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 US election. Brazil's presidential election is going to a second round, after voting on 2 October finished with no candidate achieving 50% of votes needed to prevent a run-off. \"The system is completely vulnerable,\" claimed President Bolsonaro while campaigning, without providing evidence.  In this election voting is being done electronically, as has been the case since 1996. Each candidate has a number, and on election day voters type the number of their chosen candidate into a voting machine at polling stations across the country.  The votes are then counted by the machines, and the totals are sent electronically to a central office. Votes from across the country are tallied up and a final result is announced, usually within hours of polls closing.  Each machine also prints out a paper copy of the totals for each candidate. When polls close they are displayed publicly at polling sites, and each machine's votes can be compared with the total recorded by the electoral court.  This year, for the first time, these paper copies were published online on the day of the first round vote. President Bolsonaro has said: \"We cannot have dubious elections in 2022. Public counting of votes is needed.\"  He's been making similar claims for years. After winning the 2018 presidential election in a run-off, he claimed voting fraud robbed him of an outright victory in the first round, which he won by a 17 point margin with 46% of the vote. Subsequent studies of the 2018 election didn't find any evidence of voting irregularities.  Brazilians vote electronically, so there are no paper copies of individual ballots. This has been highlighted by President Bolsonaro as a security issue, and he has called for \"printable and auditable\" paper ballots to safeguard the electronic system. \"It's impossible to audit elections in Brazil,\" President Bolsonaro declared in July during a meeting with ambassadors. He says it is \"easy to rig\" electronic voting machines by altering their source code, the internal commands within a machine's software. It's not true to say you can't audit the vote in Brazil. The machines can retrieve votes cast for an electronic recount. Such an audit took place in the 2014 presidential election, which concluded that there was no foul play. \"There is no reasonable proof of fraud going on in the past, at least in big audits that have been done,\" says Prof Marcos Simplicio, who took part in the auditing of the 2014 election. The Supreme Electoral Court, the body that oversees Brazil's election, says the system has a series of procedures in place to secure the vote. For example, a number of voting machines are selected at random to be removed from polling sites for a test vote alongside the actual vote on election day. These are checked to be working correctly by entering test votes for each of the candidates in a process witnessed by party representatives.  \"The vote placed in the electronic ballot box is secured by several mechanisms. The software goes through several tests, including tests with experts and outside investigators who try to break its security,\" says Julio Valente, the Information Technology Secretary of Brazil's electoral court. Before each election the court invites researchers and software experts to look for vulnerabilities in the voting system. This year, more than 20 experts tried to penetrate the system but failed to do so. However, over the years experts have said improvements could be made. \"The security of the Brazilian election system relies heavily on the system's software, which has been the main point of criticism from the academic community since the 90s,\" says Prof Paulo Matias, a computer security specialist at the University of S\u00e3o Carlos.  President Bolsonaro has also claimed votes are counted in a \"secret room\" out of public view at the central electoral office.  The votes are counted by computers that are located in a secure room but party representatives can monitor the process. \"The view of most of the technical community is that fraud is really hard in the current system. The system can be improved and should be, but that doesn't mean there's been fraud,\" says Prof Simplicio. Allegations that the system is unreliable have spread across social media - often in groups backing the president.  Just a quarter of Bolsonaro supporters say they trust the electoral system \"a lot\", and almost a third don't trust it \"at all\" according to a recent survey. Videos containing misleading information from previous elections are used to cast doubt on the system.  Two videos that were spread following the 2018 election showed voters entering Bolsonaro's number and receiving the message \"null vote\".  However, Brazilians don't only vote for the president. Votes are also cast for other political representatives such as senators and governors, using unique numbers to identify the candidates.  A closer look at the two videos shows that Bolsonaro's number had been pressed when the voter was asked to choose a  governor. When there is no candidate with that number, a \"null vote\" message is displayed. Voters can still correct the mistake and press the right number before confirming their vote. Another video allegedly showed a man pressing Bolsonaro's number and the machine showing his rival's picture instead.  At the time, the electoral court debunked the video, saying it had been edited. The video didn't show the voting machine buttons and screen at the same time, which meant different images could've been stitched together.
