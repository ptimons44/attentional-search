Before we get into specific coffee shops, let’s talk about the two local specialty coffee roasters in Florence. Neither actually has their own coffee shop in Florence, which is odd to me coming from the US, but they both have cafes in town that act as their flagship, using their beans as both espresso and filter offerings.

Starting in the 1970s, many farmers switched their production method to sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows under full sun with little or no forest canopy. This causes berries to ripen more rapidly and bushes to produce higher yields, but requires the clearing of trees and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, which damage the environment and cause health problems.
